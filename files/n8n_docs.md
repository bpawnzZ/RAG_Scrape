# Use case | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-5/chapter-5.0/





[Skip to content](#automating-a-business-workflow)







# Automating a business workflow[#](#automating-a-business-workflow "Permanent link")

Remember [our friend Nathan](/courses/level-one/chapter-3)?

**Nathan üôã:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.  

**You üë©‚Äçüîß:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?  

**Nathan üôã:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.  

**You üë©‚Äçüîß:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!

## Workflow design[#](#workflow-design "Permanent link")

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
2. Sort the data and format the dates.
3. Write binary files.
4. Send notifications using email and Discord.

n8n provides [core nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:

1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
2. A workflow that generates the reports.
3. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.

## Workflow prerequisites[#](#workflow-prerequisites "Permanent link")

To build the workflows, you will need the following:

* An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
* A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.
* A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).

Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.

# Workflows templates | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/





[Skip to content](#workflow-templates)







# Workflow templates[#](#workflow-templates "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

n8n provides a library of workflow templates. When embedding n8n, you can:

* Continue to use n8n's workflow templates library (this is the default behavior)
* Disable workflow templates
* Create your own workflow templates library

## Disable workflow templates[#](#disable-workflow-templates "Permanent link")

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` to false.

## Use your own workflow templates library[#](#use-your-own-workflow-templates-library "Permanent link")

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` to the base URL of your API.

Your API must provide the same endpoints and data structure as n8n's.

The endpoints are:

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET | /templates/workflows/`<id>` |
| GET | /templates/workflows |
| GET | /templates/collections/`<id>` |
| GET | /templates/collections |
| GET | /templates/categories |
| GET | /health |

To learn about the data structure, try out n8n's API endpoints:

<https://api.n8n.io/templates/categories>  

<https://api.n8n.io/templates/collections>  

<https://api.n8n.io/templates/workflows>  

<https://api.n8n.io/health>

# Workflow 3 | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/





[Skip to content](#workflow-3-monitoring-workflow-errors)







# Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors[#](#workflow-3-monitoring-workflow-errors "Permanent link")

Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.

To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).
3. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:  
   
   
   * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.
   * **Text**: "The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.
     
     Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.
4. Execute the Discord node.
5. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.

The workflow should look like this:

![Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow3.png)

*Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors*


Quiz questions

* What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What's the expression to reference the workflow name?

# Workflow 2 | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/





[Skip to content](#workflow-2-generating-reports)







# Workflow 2: Generating reports[#](#workflow-2-generating-reports "Permanent link")

In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this:

![Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2.png)

*Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files*

To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.

## Part 1: Getting data from different sources[#](#part-1-getting-data-from-different-sources "Permanent link")

The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

![Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_1.png)

*Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources*

1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:
   
   * **Method**: Get
   * **URL**: The **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   * **Authentication**: Generic Credential Type
     + **Generic Auth Type**: Header Auth
     + **Credentials for Header Auth**: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   * **Send Headers**: Toggle to true
     + **Specify Headers**: Select `Using Fields Below`
     + **Name**: `unique_id`
     + **Value**: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
2. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list data from the `customers` table (where you updated the fields `region` and `subregion`).
3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for `customerID`.
4. Use the [**Sort node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/) to sort data by `orderPrice` in descending order.

Quiz questions

* What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?
* What's the order status of customer 2?
* What's the highest order price?
## Part 2: Generating file for regional sales[#](#part-2-generating-file-for-regional-sales "Permanent link")

The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:

![Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_2.png)

*Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales*

1. Use the [**If node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.
2. Use the [**Convert to File**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)
3. Use the [**Gmail node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.
4. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   * **Text**: "I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.   
      Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with expressions that reference the data from the nodes.

Quiz questions

* How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?
* What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?
* How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?
## Part 3: Generating files for total sales[#](#part-3-generating-files-for-total-sales "Permanent link")

The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

![Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_3.png)

*Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales*

1. Use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.
2. Use the [**Set node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: `customerEmail`, `customerRegion`, `customerSince`, and `orderPrice`.
3. Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to change the date format of the field `customerSince` to the format MM/DD/YYYY.
   * Set the **Include Input Fields** option to keep all the data together.
4. Use the [**Convert to File node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: `{{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}`.
5. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   * **Text**: "I created the spreadsheet `{file name}`. My ID:" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.   
      Note that you need to replace `{file name}` with an expression that references data from the previous **Convert to File node**.

Quiz questions

* What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?
* What's the formatted date of customer 7?
* How many items does the **Convert to File node** return?

# Workflow 1: Merging data[#](#workflow-1-merging-data "Permanent link")

Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.

To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:

Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.
2. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.
4. Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.

The workflow should look like this:

![Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow1.png)

*Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API*


Quiz questions

* How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?
* How many items does the **Merge node** return?
* How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?
* What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?

# Dealing with errors in workflows | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-4/





[Skip to content](#dealing-with-errors-in-workflows)







# Dealing with errors in workflows[#](#dealing-with-errors-in-workflows "Permanent link")

Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.

But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.

## Checking failed workflows[#](#checking-failed-workflows "Permanent link")

n8n tracks executions of your workflows.

When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.

Open the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](/editor-ui/#executions) in the left-side panel.

To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.

![Executions log](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions.png)

*Executions log*

This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.

To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.

![Workflow execution view](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions_readonly.png)

*Workflow execution view*

## Catching erroring workflows[#](#catching-erroring-workflows "Permanent link")

To catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/error-workflows/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.

Use additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.

To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.

The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.

Error workflows

* If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
* If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
* You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
* You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.
### Exercise[#](#exercise "Permanent link")

In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:

1. Create a new Error Workflow.
2. Add the **Error Trigger node**.
3. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).
4. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.

Show me the solution

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Error workflow*



To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 ``` | ``` { 	"nodes": [ 		{ 			"parameters": {}, 			"name": "Error Trigger", 			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger", 			"typeVersion": 1, 			"position": [ 				720, 				-380 			] 		}, 		{ 			"parameters": { 				"channel": "channelname", 				"text": "=This workflow {{$node[\"Error Trigger\"].json[\"workflow\"][\"name\"]}}failed.\nHave a look at it here: {{$node[\"Error Trigger\"].json[\"execution\"][\"url\"]}}", 				"attachments": [], 				"otherOptions": {} 			}, 			"name": "Slack", 			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack", 			"position": [ 				900, 				-380 			], 			"typeVersion": 1, 			"credentials": { 				"slackApi": { 					"id": "17", 					"name": "slack_credentials" 				} 			} 		} 	], 	"connections": { 		"Error Trigger": { 			"main": [ 				[ 					{ 						"node": "Slack", 						"type": "main", 						"index": 0 					} 				] 			] 		} 	} }  ``` |

## Throwing exceptions in workflows[#](#throwing-exceptions-in-workflows "Permanent link")

Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:

* **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error
* **Error Object**: returns the type of error

You can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.

When to throw errors

Throwing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.

If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:

* Wrongly formatted JSON output
* Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
* Missing values
* Errors from remote servers

Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.

# Merging and splitting data[#](#merging-and-splitting-data "Permanent link")

In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.

## Merging data[#](#merging-data "Permanent link")

In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.

Merging data can involve:

* Creating one data set from multiple sources.
* Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.

One-way vs. two-way sync

In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.

In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.

[This blog tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.

In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), which provides several merging options:

* [Append](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append)
* [Combine](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine)
  + [Merge by Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-fields): requires input fields to match on
  + [Merge by Position](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-position)
  + [Multiplex](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#multiplex)
* [Choose Branch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch)

Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.

![Property Input fields in the Merge node](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/explanation_mergepropertyinput.png)

*Property Input fields in the Merge node*


Property Input in dot notation

If you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).


Note

You can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.

### Merge Exercise[#](#merge-exercise "Permanent link")

Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.

1. Add a **Merge node** that takes `Input 1` from a **Customer Datastore node** and `Input 2` from a **Code node**.
2. In the **Customer Datastore node**, run the operation **Get All People**.
3. In the **Code node**, create an array of two objects with three properties: `name`, `language`, and `country`, where the property `country` has two sub-properties `code` and `name`.
   * Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
   * For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
4. In the **Merge node**, try out different merge options.

Show me the solution

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

![Workflow exercise for merging data](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge.png)

*Workflow exercise for merging data*



If you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):

![Output of Merge node with option to keep matches](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge_kkm.png)

*Output of Merge node with option to keep matches*



To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

| ```   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 ``` | ``` { "meta": { 	"templateCredsSetupCompleted": true, 	"instanceId": "cb484ba7b742928a2048bf8829668bed5b5ad9787579adea888f05980292a4a7" }, "nodes": [ 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"mode": "combine", 		"mergeByFields": { 		"values": [ 			{ 			"field1": "name", 			"field2": "name" 			} 		] 		}, 		"options": {} 	}, 	"id": "578365f3-26dd-4fa6-9858-f0a5fdfc413b", 	"name": "Merge", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.merge", 	"typeVersion": 2.1, 	"position": [ 		720, 		580 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": {}, 	"id": "71aa5aad-afdf-4f8a-bca0-34450eee8acc", 	"name": "When clicking \"Test workflow\"", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger", 	"typeVersion": 1, 	"position": [ 		260, 		560 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"operation": "getAllPeople" 	}, 	"id": "497174fe-3cab-4160-8103-78b44efd038d", 	"name": "Customer Datastore (n8n training)", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore", 	"typeVersion": 1, 	"position": [ 		500, 		460 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"jsCode": "return [\n  {\n    'name': 'Jay Gatsby',\n    'language': 'English',\n    'country': {\n      'code': 'US',\n      'name': 'United States'\n    }\n    \n  }\n  \n];" 	}, 	"id": "387e8a1e-e796-4f05-8e75-7ce25c786c5f", 	"name": "Code", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.code", 	"typeVersion": 2, 	"position": [ 		500, 		720 	] 	} ], "connections": { 	"When clicking \"Test workflow\"": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Customer Datastore (n8n training)", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		}, 		{ 			"node": "Code", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	}, 	"Customer Datastore (n8n training)": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Merge", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	}, 	"Code": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Merge", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 1 		} 		] 	] 	} }, "pinData": {} }  ``` |

## Looping[#](#looping "Permanent link")

In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).

n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.

However, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.

To [create a loop in an n8n workflow](/flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n), you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.

## Splitting data in batches[#](#splitting-data-in-batches "Permanent link")

If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.

For these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/). This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.

Execution of Loop Over Items node

The **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.

### Loop/Batch Exercise[#](#loopbatch-exercise "Permanent link")

Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:

1. A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).
2. A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.
3. An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
   * The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.

Show me the solution

1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:
   * Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.
   * Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.
   * Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:
     
     | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` let urls = [ 	{ 		json: { 		url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io' 		} 	}, 	{ 	json: { 		url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n' 		}  	} ] return urls;  ``` |
     | --- | --- |
2. Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.
   * Set **Batch Size** to `1`.
3. The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called "Replace Me". Replace that node with an **RSS Read node**.
   * Set the **URL** to use the url from the Code Node: `{{ $json.url }}`.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

![Workflow for getting RSS feeds from two blogs](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_splitinbatches.png)

*Workflow for getting RSS feeds from two blogs*



To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

| ```   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 ``` | ``` { "meta": { 	"templateCredsSetupCompleted": true, 	"instanceId": "cb484ba7b742928a2048bf8829668bed5b5ad9787579adea888f05980292a4a7" }, "nodes": [ 	{ 	"parameters": {}, 	"id": "ed8dc090-ae8c-4db6-a93b-0fa873015c25", 	"name": "When clicking \"Test workflow\"", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger", 	"typeVersion": 1, 	"position": [ 		460, 		460 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"jsCode": "let urls = [\n  {\n    json: {\n      url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io'\n    }\n  },\n  {\n   json: {\n     url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n'\n   } \n  }\n]\n\nreturn urls;" 	}, 	"id": "1df2a9bf-f970-4e04-b906-92dbbc9e8d3a", 	"name": "Code", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.code", 	"typeVersion": 2, 	"position": [ 		680, 		460 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"options": {} 	}, 	"id": "3cce249a-0eab-42e2-90e3-dbdf3684e012", 	"name": "Loop Over Items", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches", 	"typeVersion": 3, 	"position": [ 		900, 		460 	] 	}, 	{ 	"parameters": { 		"url": "={{ $json.url }}", 		"options": {} 	}, 	"id": "50e1c1dc-9a5d-42d3-b7c0-accc31636aa6", 	"name": "RSS Read", 	"type": "n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead", 	"typeVersion": 1, 	"position": [ 		1120, 		460 	] 	} ], "connections": { 	"When clicking \"Test workflow\"": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Code", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	}, 	"Code": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Loop Over Items", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	}, 	"Loop Over Items": { 	"main": [ 		null, 		[ 		{ 			"node": "RSS Read", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	}, 	"RSS Read": { 	"main": [ 		[ 		{ 			"node": "Loop Over Items", 			"type": "main", 			"index": 0 		} 		] 	] 	} }, "pinData": {} }  ``` |

# Processing different data types[#](#processing-different-data-types "Permanent link")

In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using [n8n core nodes](/workflows/components/nodes/).

## HTML and XML data[#](#html-and-xml-data "Permanent link")

You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.

HTML vs. XML

HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.

If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

Use the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).

### HTML Exercise[#](#html-exercise "Permanent link")

Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).
2. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
   * Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.item-title a` should help!

Show me the solution

1. Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:
   * **Authentication**: None
   * **Request Method**: GET
   * **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/
     The result should look like this:

![Result of HTTP Request node](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_httprequestnode.png)

*Result of HTTP Request node*



2. Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:
   * **Operation**: Extract HTML Content
   * **Source Data**: JSON
   * **JSON Property**: data
   * **Extraction Values**:
     + **Key**: title
     + **CSS Selector**: `.item-title a`
     + **Return Value**: HTML

You can add more values to extract more data.

The result should look like this:

![Result of HTML Extract node](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_htmlextractnode.png)

*Result of HTML Extract node*



Use the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.

### XML Exercise[#](#xml-exercise "Permanent link")

In the [final exercise of Chapter 1](/courses/level-two/chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the Quotable API. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:

1. Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the Quotable API at `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`.
2. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.

Show me the solution

1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
   * **Authentication**: None
   * **Request Method**: GET
   * **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes
2. Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:
   * **Mode**: JSON to XML
   * **Property name**: data

The result should look like this:

![Table view of XML Node (JSON to XML)](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_xmlnode_table.png)

*XML node (JSON to XML) ‚Äì Table View*



To transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.

## Date, time, and interval data[#](#date-time-and-interval-data "Permanent link")

Date and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:

* `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29
* `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30
* `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00
* `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)
* `YEAR`: 2022, 22

There are a few ways you can work with dates and times:

* Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.
* Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.

Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.

If you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:

* At a specific time.
* After a specified time interval.
* On a webhook call.

### Date Exercise[#](#date-exercise "Permanent link")

Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.

To begin:

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.
2. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.
3. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.
4. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.
5. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.
6. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)

Show me the solution

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.
   * Select the option to **Return All**.
2. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.
   * Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.
   * Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.
   * Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.
   * In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**
3. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.
   * Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.
   * Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**
   * Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)
4. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.
   * Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.
   * Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.
   * Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.
5. Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.
   * Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.
   * Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.
   * Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.
6. Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.
   * Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.
   * Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.
   * To test your schedule, be sure to activate the workflow.

## Binary data[#](#binary-data "Permanent link")

Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.

In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:

* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.
* [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
* [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
* [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n

Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.

To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).

Naming the right path

The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:

* npm: `~/my_file.json`
* n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`
### Binary Exercise 1[#](#binary-exercise-1 "Permanent link")

For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:

1. Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: `https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.`
2. Use the **Extract From File node** to convert the file from binary to JSON.

Show me the solution

In the **HTTP Request node**, you should see the PDF file, like this:

![HTTP Request node to get PDF](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_binarydata_httprequest_file.png)

*HTTP Request node to get PDF*



When you convert the PDF from binary to JSON using the **Extract From File node**, the result should look like this:

### Binary Exercise 2[#](#binary-exercise-2 "Permanent link")

For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:

1. Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API `https://poetrydb.org/random/1`.
2. Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the **Convert to File node**.
3. Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the **Read/Write Files From Disk node**.
4. To check that it worked out, use the **Read/Write Files From Disk node** to read the generated binary file.

# Understanding the data structure[#](#understanding-the-data-structure "Permanent link")

In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to transform data and simulate node outputs.

## Data structure of n8n[#](#data-structure-of-n8n "Permanent link")

In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.

The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.

About array of objects

An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Donatello", "Raphael"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.

An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` { 	name: 'Michelangelo', 	color: 'blue', }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` var turtles = [ 	{ 		name: 'Michelangelo', 		color: 'orange', 	}, 	{ 		name: 'Donatello', 		color: 'purple', 	}, 	{ 		name: 'Raphael', 		color: 'red', 	}, 	{ 		name: 'Leonardo', 		color: 'blue', 	} ];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.

Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png)

*Items*

An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.

![](/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)

*Items in the Customer Datastore node*

## Creating data sets with the Code node[#](#creating-data-sets-with-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` return [ 	{ 		json: { 			apple: 'beets', 		} 	} ];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png)

*Array of objects in the Code node*


JSON objects

Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_datastructure.png)

*Illustration of data structure in n8n*

It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.

You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.

### Exercise[#](#exercise "Permanent link")

In a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` var myContacts = [ 	{ 		json: { 			name: 'Alice', 			email: { 				personal: 'alice@home.com', 				work: 'alice@wonderland.org' 			}, 		} 	}, 	{ 		json: { 			name: 'Bob', 			email: { 				personal: 'bob@mail.com', 				work: 'contact@thebuilder.com' 				}, 		} 	}, ];  return myContacts;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

*Result of Code node*



## Referencing node data with the Code node[#](#referencing-node-data-with-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Just like you can use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.

Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.

### Exercise[#](#exercise_1 "Permanent link")

Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` let items = $input.all(); items[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work']; return items;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

*Code node reference*



## Transforming data[#](#transforming-data "Permanent link")

The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](/data/transforming-data/), so that each item can be processed individually.

The two most common operations for data transformation are:

* Creating multiple items from one item
* Creating a single item from multiple items

There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:

* Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](/data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node**:
  + Use the [**Split Out node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
  + Use the [**Aggregate node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:
  + To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ "data": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:
    
    | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {     return {         json: item     } });  ``` |
    | --- | --- |
  + To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:
    
    | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` return [ 	{     	json: {     		data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)     	}     }   ];  ``` |
    | --- | --- |

These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` let items = $input.all(); return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => { 	return { 		json: item 	} });  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Exercise[#](#exercise_2 "Permanent link")

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the Quotable API `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`. (This API requires no authentication).
2. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.
3. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.

Show me the solution

1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
   * **Authentication**: None
   * **Request Method**: GET
   * **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes
2. To transform the data with the **Split Out node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:
   * **Field To Split Out**: results
   * **Include**: No Other Fields
3. To transform the data with the **Code node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` let items = $input.all(); return items[0].json.results.map(item => { 	return { 		json: item 	} });  ``` |

# Exporting and importing workflows | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-6/





[Skip to content](#exporting-and-importing-workflows)







# Exporting and importing workflows[#](#exporting-and-importing-workflows "Permanent link")

In this chapter, you will learn how to export and import workflows.

## Exporting and importing workflows[#](#exporting-and-importing-workflows_1 "Permanent link")

You can save n8n workflows locally as JSON files. This is useful if you want to share your workflow with someone else or import a workflow from someone else.

Sharing credentials

Exported workflow JSON files include credential names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.


![Import/Export menu](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-six/l1-c6-import-export-menu.png)

*Import & Export workflows menu*

You can export and import workflows in two ways:

* From the **Editor UI**:
  + Export: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Download**. This will download your current workflow as a JSON file on your computer.
  + Import: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select¬†**Import from URL** (to import a published workflow) or¬†**Import from File** (to import a workflow as a JSON file).
* From the command line:
  + Export: See the [full list of commands](/hosting/cli-commands/)  for exporting workflows or credentials.
  + Import: See the [full list of commands](/hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials)  for importing workflows or credentials.

# Activating and examining the workflow | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.8/





[Skip to content](#8-activating-and-examining-the-workflow)







# 8. Activating and Examining the Workflow[#](#8-activating-and-examining-the-workflow "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to activate your workflow and change the default workflow settings.

Activating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows are deactivated.

To activate your workflow, set the **Inactive** toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be **Activated**. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:

![Activated workflow](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-activated-workflow.png)

*Activated workflow*

## Workflow Executions[#](#workflow-executions "Permanent link")

An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow was completed successfully or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.

To see the execution log, in your Editor UI select **All executions** in the left panel. This will open the **Executions** window.

![Execution List](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-execution-list.png)

*Execution List*

The **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:

* **Name**: The name of the workflow
* **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started
* **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute
* **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution

Workflow execution status

You can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**).
The information displayed here depends on which executions are configured to be saved in the [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).

## Workflow Settings[#](#workflow-settings "Permanent link")

You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some of the global default settings in¬†[**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).

Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI, then select **Settings**.

![Workflow Settings](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-workflow-settings.png)

*Workflow Settings*

In the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:

* [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/):¬†A workflow to run in case the execution of the current workflow fails.
* **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows that are allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).
* **Timezone**:¬†The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone (by default "New York") is used. This setting is particularly important for the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.
* **Save failed production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it fails. Default is to save.
* **Save successful production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it succeeds. Default is to save.
* **Save manual executions**: If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Default is to save.
* **Save execution progress**: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is not to save.
* **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is not to timeout.

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.

**Nathan üôã**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people.

# Scheduling the workflow | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.7/





[Skip to content](#7-scheduling-the-workflow)







# 7. Scheduling the Workflow[#](#7-scheduling-the-workflow "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node.

The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Test Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.

To achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.

## Remove the Manual Trigger node[#](#remove-the-manual-trigger-node "Permanent link")

First, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:

1. Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.
2. Select the trash can icon to delete.

The Manual Trigger node will be removed and you'll see an "Add first step" option.

## Add the Schedule Trigger node[#](#add-the-schedule-trigger-node "Permanent link")

1. Open the nodes panel and search for **Schedule Trigger**.
2. Select it when it appears in the search results.

In the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:

* **Trigger Interval**: Select **Weeks**.
* **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter `1`.
* **Trigger on weekdays**: Select **Monday** (and remove **Sunday** if it was automatically added).
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select **9am**.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter¬†`0`.

Your Schedule Trigger node should look like this:

![Schedule Trigger Node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-schedule-trigger-node.png)

*Schedule Trigger Node*


Keep in mind

To ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure the timezone is set correctly for your [n8n instance](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) or the [workflow's settings](/workflows/settings/). The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.

## Connect the Schedule Trigger node[#](#connect-the-schedule-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Return to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.

Your full workflow should look like this:

![Full workflow](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-inactivated-workflow.png)

*Full workflow*

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on **Test workflow**, all nodes will be executed: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.

**Nathan üôã**: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log.

# Notifying the team | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6/





[Skip to content](#6-notifying-the-team)







# 6. Notifying the Team[#](#6-notifying-the-team "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/).

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.

Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.

Communication nodes

You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/).

In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.

When you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.

In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:

* **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.
* **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.
  + Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.
  + Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.
* **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.
* **Message**:
  + Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.
  + Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.
    
    - `This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}`
    
    Constructing your own message
    
    To add the Unique ID portion of the statement, you'll need to expand **Nodes** > **HTTP Request** > **Parameters** > **headerParameters** > **parameters** > **[Item: 0]** and select the **value**.

Now select **Test step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:

![Discord node output](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-6-discord-output.png)

*Discord node output*

And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

![Discord message](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/discord-output.png)

*Discord message*

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: Incredible, you've saved me so many hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM...

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.

# White labelling | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/





[Skip to content](#white-labelling)







# White labelling[#](#white-labelling "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

White labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n):

* [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system): n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components
* [packages/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui): n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

Create a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and clone your new repository.

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n cd n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Install all dependencies, build and start n8n.

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` npm install npm run build npm run start  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Whenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes.

## Theme colors[#](#theme-colors "Permanent link")

To customize theme colors open [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system) and start with:

* [packages/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss)
* [packages/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss)

At the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` @mixin theme { 	--color-primary-h: 6.9; 	--color-primary-s: 100%; 	--color-primary-l: 67.6%;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

In the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` @mixin theme { 	--color-primary-h: 204; 	--color-primary-s: 100%; 	--color-primary-l: 50%;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![Example Theme Color Customization](/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)

## Theme logos[#](#theme-logos "Permanent link")

To change the editor‚Äôs logo assets look into [packages/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui/public) and replace:

* favicon-16x16.png
* favicon-32x32.png
* favicon.ico
* n8n-logo.svg
* n8n-logo-collapsed.svg
* n8n-logo-expanded.svg

Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:

* [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue): top/left logo in the main sidebar.
* [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/Logo.vue): reused in other components.

In the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.

![Example Logo Main Sidebar](/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)

If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue).

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` .logoItem { 	display: flex; 	justify-content: space-between; 	height: $header-height; 	line-height: $header-height; 	margin: 0 !important; 	border-radius: 0 !important; 	border-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight); 	cursor: default;  	&:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover { 		background-color: initial !important; 	}  	* { vertical-align: middle; } 	.icon { 		height: 18px; 		position: relative; 		left: 6px; 	}  }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Text localization[#](#text-localization "Permanent link")

To change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json).

n8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages).

In the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue).

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	"_brand.name": "My Brand", 	//replace n8n with link to _brand.name 	"about.aboutN8n": "About @:_brand.name", 	"about.n8nVersion": "@:_brand.name Version", }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![Example About Modal Localization](/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)

### Window title[#](#window-title "Permanent link")

To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:

* [packages/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/index.html)
* [packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts)

The following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `titleChange.ts`.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> 	<!-- Replace html title attribute --> 	<title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title> </head>  ``` |
| --- | --- |


| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` $titleSet(workflow: string, status: WorkflowTitleStatus) { 	// replace n8n prefix 	window.document.title = `My Brand - ${icon} ${workflow}`; },  $titleReset() { 	// replace n8n prefix 	document.title = `My Brand - Workflow Automation`; },  ``` |

# Workflow management | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/





[Skip to content](#workflow-management-in-embed)







# Workflow management in Embed[#](#workflow-management-in-embed "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

When managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a workflow for each user | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger) | Requires managing multiple workflows. |
| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |

Warning

The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.

## Workflow per user[#](#workflow-per-user "Permanent link")

There are three general steps to follow:

* Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.
* Create the n8n credentials for this user.
* Create the workflow.

### 1. Obtain user credentials[#](#1-obtain-user-credentials "Permanent link")

Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.

### 2. Create user credentials[#](#2-create-user-credentials "Permanent link")

After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI[#](#using-the-editor-ui "Permanent link")

1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.
2. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.
   ![Create New Credentials drop-down](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials.png)
3. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.
   ![Create New Credentials modal](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)
4. Click **Create** to finish and save.

#### Using the API[#](#using-the-api "Permanent link")

The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.

For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials  ``` |
| --- | --- |

With the request body:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` {    "name":"MyAirtable",    "type":"airtableApi",    "nodesAccess":[       {          "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable"       }    ],    "data":{       "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"    } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` {    "data":{       "name":"MyAirtable",       "type":"airtableApi",       "data":{          "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"       },       "nodesAccess":[          {             "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable",             "date":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z"          }       ],       "id":"29",       "createdAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z",       "updatedAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z"    } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 3. Create the workflow[#](#3-create-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Best practice is to have a ‚Äúbase‚Äù workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI[#](#using-the-editor-ui_1 "Permanent link")

1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.
2. Select **Workflows** > **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.
   ![Duplicate workflow](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/duplicate_workflow.png)
3. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above).
4. **Save** this workflow set it to **Active** using the toggle in the top-right corner.

#### Using the API[#](#using-the-api_1 "Permanent link")

1. Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id>`
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` GET https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

The response will contain the JSON data of the selected workflow:

| ```   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 ``` | ``` {   "data": {     "id": "1012",     "name": "Nathan's Workflow",     "active": false,     "nodes": [       {         "parameters": {},         "name": "Start",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.start",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           130,           640         ]       },       {         "parameters": {           "authentication": "headerAuth",           "url": "https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/custom-erp",           "options": {             "splitIntoItems": true           },           "headerParametersUi": {             "parameter": [               {                 "name": "unique_id",                 "value": "recLhLYQbzNSFtHNq"               }             ]           }         },         "name": "HTTP Request",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           430,           300         ],         "credentials": {           "httpHeaderAuth": "beginner_course"         }       },       {         "parameters": {           "operation": "append",           "application": "appKBGQfbm6NfW6bv",           "table": "processingOrders",           "options": {}         },         "name": "Airtable",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.airtable",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           990,           210         ],         "credentials": {           "airtableApi": "Airtable"         }       },       {         "parameters": {           "conditions": {             "string": [               {                 "value1": "={{$json[\"orderStatus\"]}}",                 "value2": "processing"               }             ]           }         },         "name": "IF",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.if",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           630,           300         ]       },       {         "parameters": {           "keepOnlySet": true,           "values": {             "number": [               {                 "name": "=orderId",                 "value": "={{$json[\"orderID\"]}}"               }             ],             "string": [               {                 "name": "employeeName",                 "value": "={{$json[\"employeeName\"]}}"               }             ]           },           "options": {}         },         "name": "Set",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.set",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           800,           210         ]       },       {         "parameters": {           "functionCode": "let totalBooked = items.length;\nlet bookedSum = 0;\n\nfor(let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {\n  bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;\n}\nreturn [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}]\n"         },         "name": "Function",         "type": "n8n-nodes-base.function",         "typeVersion": 1,         "position": [           800,           400         ]       },       {         "parameters": {           "webhookUri": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/865213348202151968/oD5_WPDQwtr22Vjd_82QP3-_4b_lGhAeM7RynQ8Js5DzyXrQEnj0zeAQIA6fki1JLtXE",           "text": "=This week we have {{$json[\"totalBooked\"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json[\"bookedSum\"]}}.

| --- | --- |

1. Save the returned JSON data and update any relevant credentials and fields for the new user.
2. Create a new workflow using the updated JSON as the request body at endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows`
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

The response will contain the ID of the new workflow, which you will use in the next step.

1. Lastly, activate the new workflow:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` PATCH https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

Passing the additional value `active` in your JSON payload:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` // ... "active":true, "settings": {}, "staticData": null, "tags": []  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Single workflow[#](#single-workflow "Permanent link")

There are four steps to follow to implement this method:

* Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. See [Obtain user credentials](#1-obtain-user-credentials) above.
* Create the n8n credentials for this user. See [Create user credentials](#2-create-user-credentials) above.
* Create the workflow.
* Call the workflow as needed.

### Create the workflow[#](#create-the-workflow "Permanent link")

The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:

* This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
* The incoming webhook call must contain the user‚Äôs credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
* Each node where the user‚Äôs credentials are needed should use an [expression](/code/expressions/) so that the node‚Äôs credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
* Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.

### Call the workflow[#](#call-the-workflow "Permanent link")

For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters).

# n8n Embed Configuration | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/





[Skip to content](#configuration)







# Configuration[#](#configuration "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

## Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

You can secure n8n by setting up [User management](/user-management/), n8n's built-in authentication feature.

n8n supports [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](/user-management/saml/).

### Credential overwrites[#](#credential-overwrites "Permanent link")

To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite credentials on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.

In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using OAuth by pressing the "connect" button on the credentials.

n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.

#### Using environment variables[#](#using-environment-variables "Permanent link")

You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.

Warning

Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.

#### Using REST APIs[#](#using-rest-apis "Permanent link")

The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.

Note

The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.

For example:

1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` {     "asanaOAuth2Api": {         "clientId": "<id>",         "clientSecret": "<secret>"     },     "githubOAuth2Api": {         "clientId": "<id>",         "clientSecret": "<secret>"     } }  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

Note

There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.
In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.

## Environment variables[#](#environment-variables "Permanent link")

n8n has many [environment variables](/reference/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |
| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"` |
| `NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load. |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable workflow templates (true) or disable (false). |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates/) for more information. |

## Backend hooks[#](#backend-hooks "Permanent link")

It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.

### Available hooks[#](#available-hooks "Permanent link")

| Hook | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `credentials.create` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before new credentials get created. Use to restrict the number of credentials. |
| `credentials.delete` | `[id: credentialId]` | Called before credentials get deleted. |
| `credentials.update` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before existing credentials are saved. |
| `frontend.settings` | `[frontendSettings: IN8nUISettings]` | Gets called on n8n startup. Allows you to, for example, overwrite frontend data like the displayed OAuth URL. |
| `n8n.ready` | `[app: App]` | Called once n8n is ready. Use to, for example, register custom API endpoints. |
| `n8n.stop` |  | Called when an n8n process gets stopped. Allows you to save some process data. |
| `oauth1.authenticate` | `[oAuthOptions: clientOAuth1.Options, oauthRequestData: {oauth_callback: string}]` | Called before an OAuth1 authentication. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `oauth2.callback` | `[oAuth2Parameters: {clientId: string, clientSecret: string \| undefined, accessTokenUri: string, authorizationUri: string, redirectUri: string, scopes: string[]}]` | Called in an OAuth2 callback. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `workflow.activate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowDb]` | Called before a workflow gets activated. Use to restrict the number of active workflows. |
| `workflow.afterDelete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after a workflow gets deleted. |
| `workflow.afterUpdate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after an existing workflow gets saved. |
| `workflow.create` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before a workflow gets created. Use to restrict the number of saved workflows. |
| `workflow.delete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called before a workflow gets delete. |
| `workflow.postExecute` | `[run: IRun, workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after a workflow gets executed. |
| `workflow.preExecute` | `[workflow: Workflow: mode: WorkflowExecuteMode]` | Called before a workflow gets executed. Allows you to count or limit the number of workflow executions. |
| `workflow.update` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before an existing workflow gets saved. |

### Registering hooks[#](#registering-hooks "Permanent link")

Set hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.
To register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.

You can set the variable to a single file:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`

Or to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js`

### Backend hook files[#](#backend-hook-files "Permanent link")

Hook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` module.exports = {     "frontend": {         "settings": [             async function (settings) {                 settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth1 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth1/callback';                 settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth2 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth2/callback';             }         ]     },     "workflow": {         "activate": [             async function (workflowData) {                 const activeWorkflows = await this.dbCollections.Workflow.count({ active: true });                  if (activeWorkflows > 1) {                     throw new Error(                         'Active workflow limit reached.'                     );                 }             }         ]     } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Backend hook functions[#](#backend-hook-functions "Permanent link")

A hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.

If the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.

You can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](#backend-hook-files).

## Frontend external hooks[#](#frontend-external-hooks "Permanent link")

Like backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.

### Available hooks[#](#available-hooks_1 "Permanent link")

| `workflowRun.runWorkflow` | Called when a workflow executes. |
| `workflowSettings.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `workflowSettings.saveSettings` | Called when someone saves the settings of a workflow. |

### Registering hooks[#](#registering-hooks_1 "Permanent link")

You can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <script src="frontend-hooks.js"></script>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Frontend hook files[#](#frontend-hook-files "Permanent link")

Frontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` window.n8nExternalHooks = {   nodeView: {     mount: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },     ],     createNodeActiveChanged: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },       function (store, meta) {         // do something else       },     ],     addNodeButton: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },     ],   }, };  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Frontend hook functions[#](#frontend-hook-functions "Permanent link")

You can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:

* `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.
* `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package.

# Deployment | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/





[Skip to content](#deployment)







# Deployment[#](#deployment "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

See the [hosting documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/server-setup.html) for detailed setup options.

## User data[#](#user-data "Permanent link")

n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.

Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).

## Backups[#](#backups "Permanent link")

n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.

## Restarting[#](#restarting "Permanent link")

If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data.

# Prerequisites | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/





[Skip to content](#prerequisites)







# Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.

| Component | Sizing | Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU/vCPU | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |
| Database | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD | SQLite or PostgreSQL |
| Memory | 320 MB - 2 GB |  |

## CPU considerations[#](#cpu-considerations "Permanent link")

n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.

## Database considerations[#](#database-considerations "Permanent link")

n8n uses its database to store credentials, past executions, and workflows.

A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.

n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.

For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.

### Best practices[#](#best-practices "Permanent link")

* SSD storage.
* In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.
* If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.
* Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.
* Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.

## Memory considerations[#](#memory-considerations "Permanent link")

An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.

For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](/code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources.

# Using the API playground | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/api/using-api-playground/





[Skip to content](#using-the-api-playground)







# Using the API playground[#](#using-the-api-playground "Permanent link")

Feature availability

The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.

The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.

n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.

Real data

If you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.

The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}  ``` |
| --- | --- |


How to find `credentialTypeName`

To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` {     ...,     "credentials": {         "googleDriveOAuth2Api": {         "id": "9",         "name": "Google Drive"         }     } }  ``` |

# Pagination | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/api/pagination/





[Skip to content](#api-pagination)







# API pagination[#](#api-pagination "Permanent link")

The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.

When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.

Get the first page:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` # For a self-hosted n8n instance curl -X 'GET' \   '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \   -H 'accept: application/json' \   -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'  # For n8n Cloud curl -X 'GET' \   '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \   -H 'accept: application/json' \   -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The response is in JSON format, and includes a `nextCursor` value. This is an example response.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` {   "data": [     // The response contains an object for each workflow     {       // Workflow data     }   ],   "nextCursor": "MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA" }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Then to request the next page:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` # For a self-hosted n8n instance curl -X 'GET' \   '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \   -H 'accept: application/json'  # For n8n Cloud curl -X 'GET' \   '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \   -H 'accept: application/json'  ``` |

# What are vector databases? | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-vector-databases/





[Skip to content](#what-are-vector-databases)







# What are vector databases?[#](#what-are-vector-databases "Permanent link")

Vector databases store information as numbers:

> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))

This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.

## A simplified example[#](#a-simplified-example "Permanent link")

A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.

Suppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:

| Sentence | Vector (array of dimensions) |
| --- | --- |
| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] |
| Zapier is an automation tool | [0.1] |
| Make is an automation tool | [0.1] |
| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host | [0.3] |

This example is very simplified

In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.

## Demonstrating the power of similarity search[#](#demonstrating-the-power-of-similarity-search "Permanent link")

Qdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.

> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))

For full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).

## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders[#](#embeddings-retrievers-text-splitters-and-document-loaders "Permanent link")

Vector databases require other tools to function:

* Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
* Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
* Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.

# What's a tool in AI? | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/





[Skip to content](#whats-a-tool-in-ai)







# What's a tool in AI?[#](#whats-a-tool-in-ai "Permanent link")

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))

## AI tools in n8n[#](#ai-tools-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

* [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
* [Custom Code Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
* [HTTP Request Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Custom n8n Workflow Tool:

* [Chat with Google Sheets](/advanced-ai/examples/data-google-sheets/)
* [Call an API to fetch data](/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/)
* [Set up a human fallback](/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/)

# What's memory in AI? | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-memory/





[Skip to content](#whats-memory-in-ai)







# What's memory in AI?[#](#whats-memory-in-ai "Permanent link")

Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The memory keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.

## AI memory in n8n[#](#ai-memory-in-n8n "Permanent link")

To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:

* [Window Buffer Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/): stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
* One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
  + [Motorhead](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)
  + [Redis Chat Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryredischat/)
  + [Postgres Chat Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/)
  + [Xata](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryxata/)
  + [Zep](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)

If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the [Chat Memory Manager](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node.

This node is useful when you:

* Can't add a memory node directly.
* Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
* Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.

# What's an agent in AI? | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-agents/





[Skip to content](#whats-an-agent-in-ai)







# What's an agent in AI?[#](#whats-an-agent-in-ai "Permanent link")

One way to think of an agent is as a [chain](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-chains/) that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.

Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and tools. When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.

## Agents in n8n[#](#agents-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.

When execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.

[Skip to content](#whats-a-chain-in-ai)







# What's a chain in AI?[#](#whats-a-chain-in-ai "Permanent link")

Chains bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and memory (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).

## Chains in n8n[#](#chains-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n provides three chain nodes:

* [Basic LLM Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
* [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a vector store using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
* [Summarization Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.

# Let AI specify tool parameters | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/





[Skip to content](#let-ai-specify-the-tool-parameters)







# Let AI specify the tool parameters[#](#let-ai-specify-the-tool-parameters "Permanent link")

When configuring [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) tools connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details.

There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them.

## Let the model fill in the parameter[#](#let-the-model-fill-in-the-parameter "Permanent link")

Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end:

![image showing stars icon to the right of parameter field](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-stars.png)

On activating this button, the AI Agent will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input.
The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model.

If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section.

Warning

Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added.

## Use the `$fromAI()` function[#](#use-the-fromai-function "Permanent link")

The `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/). You can use the `$fromAI()` function in expressions within [app nodes](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) (like [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/), [Notion](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/), or [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)) which are connected to the **AI Agent** as tools.

Only for the Node Tools

The `$fromAI()` function is only available for [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) tools connected to the Tools Agent. It isn't possible to use the `$fromAI()` function with the [Call n8n Workflow](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/), [Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/), [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/), or [other cluster sub-nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{ $fromAI('email') }}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

### Parameters[#](#parameters "Permanent link")

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | ‚úÖ | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `description` | string | ‚ùå | A string describing the argument. |
| `type` | string | ‚ùå | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string). |
| `defaultValue` | any | ‚ùå | The default value to use for the argument. |

### Examples[#](#examples "Permanent link")

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $fromAI("name", "The commenter's name", "string", "Jane Doe")  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $fromAI("name")  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $fromAI("numItemsInStock", "Number of items in stock", "number", 5)  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Templates[#](#templates "Permanent link")

You can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following templates:

* [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)
* [Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier](https://n8n.io/workflows/2468-automate-customer-support-issue-resolution-using-ai-text-classifier/)

# Pagination | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/





[Skip to content](#pagination-in-the-http-request-node)







# Pagination in the HTTP Request node[#](#pagination-in-the-http-request-node "Permanent link")

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](/code/builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

* Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
* Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
* The structure of the data that the API returns.
## Enable pagination[#](#enable-pagination "Permanent link")

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`[#](#use-a-url-from-the-response-to-get-the-next-page-using-response "Permanent link")

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.
2. In **Next URL**, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{ $response.body["next-page"] }}  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`[#](#get-the-next-page-by-number-using-pagecount "Permanent link")

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
2. Set **Type** to **Query**.
3. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
4. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
5. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters[#](#navigate-pagination-through-body-parameters "Permanent link")

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
2. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
3. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
4. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
5. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
6. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

## Set the page size in the query[#](#set-the-page-size-in-the-query "Permanent link")

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
2. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
3. In **Value**, enter your page size.

# Output to the browser console with `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node[#](#output-to-the-browser-console-with-consolelog-or-print-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/).

## console.log (JavaScript)[#](#consolelog-javascript "Permanent link")

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log).

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` let a = "apple"; console.log(a);  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## print (Python)[#](#print-python "Permanent link")

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/).

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python**, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` a = "apple" print(a)  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`[#](#handling-an-output-of-object-object "Permanent link")

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.

To check the data type:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` print(type(myData))  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### JsProxy[#](#jsproxy "Permanent link")

If `type()` outputs `<class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>`, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using `to_py()`. This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all(); for item in previousNodeData: 	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'> 	# You need to convert it to a Dict 	itemDict = item.json.to_py() 	print(itemDict)  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to the Pyodide documentation on [JsProxy](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.JsProxy) for more information on this class.

# Get the binary data buffer | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/





[Skip to content](#get-the-binary-data-buffer)







# Get the binary data buffer[#](#get-the-binary-data-buffer "Permanent link")

The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:

* Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
* Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
* Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.

Not available in Python

`getBinaryDataBuffer()` isn't supported when using Python.

You can access the buffer using n8n's `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` /*  * itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data. * binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property.  * The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'.  */ let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For example:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data'); // Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You should always use the `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like `items[0].binary.data.data`.

# Get number of items returned by the previous node[#](#get-number-of-items-returned-by-the-previous-node "Permanent link")

To get the number of items returned by the previous node:

JavaScriptPython

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` if (Object.keys(items[0].json).length === 0) { return [ 	{ 		json: { 			results: 0, 		} 	} ] } return [ 	{ 		json: { 			results: items.length, 		} 	} ];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The output will be similar to the following.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"results": 8 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` if len(items[0].json) == 0: 	return [ 		{ 			"json": { 				"results": 0, 			} 		} 	] else: 	return [ 		{ 			"json": { 				"results": items.length, 			} 		} 	]  ``` |

The output will be similar to the following.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"results": 8 	} ]  ``` |

[Skip to content](#langchain-concepts-in-n8n)







# LangChain concepts in n8n[#](#langchain-concepts-in-n8n "Permanent link")

This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.

This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/).

n8n implements LangChain JS

This feature is n8n's implementation of [LangChain's JavaScript framework](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).

## Trigger nodes[#](#trigger-nodes "Permanent link")

[Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)

## Cluster nodes[#](#cluster-nodes "Permanent link")

Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

# Expressions common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/expressions/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#expressions-common-issues)







# Expressions common issues[#](#expressions-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues related to [expressions](/code/expressions/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON[#](#the-json-output-in-item-0-contains-invalid-json "Permanent link")

This error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.

To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:

* Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).
* Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.

## Can't get data for expression[#](#cant-get-data-for-expression "Permanent link")

This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.

Another variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

> An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn‚Äôt been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $("<node-name>").isExecuted  ``` |
| --- | --- |

As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` {   "my_field_1": {{ $input.params }} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Invalid syntax[#](#invalid-syntax "Permanent link")

This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.

For example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` {   "my_field_1": "value",   "my_field_2": {{ $('If').item.json. }} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To resolve this error, check your [expression syntax](https://www.notion.so/code/expressions/) to make sure they follow the expected format.

# Check incoming data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/





[Skip to content](#check-incoming-data)







# Check incoming data[#](#check-incoming-data "Permanent link")

At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return `not found` if the variable is empty.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$json["variable_name"]? $json["variable_name"] :"not found"}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

As an alternative, you can use the [nullish coalescing operator (??)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) or the [logical or operator (||)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` {{ $x ?? "default value" }} {{ $x || "default value" }}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

In either of the above two cases, the value of `$x` will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string `default value` is the fallback value.

# Tutorial: Build an AI workflow in n8n | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial/





[Skip to content](#build-an-ai-chat-agent-with-n8n)







# Build an AI chat agent with n8n[#](#build-an-ai-chat-agent-with-n8n "Permanent link")

Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes.

!["Screenshot of the completed workflow"](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro01.png)

Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both!

### What you will need[#](#what-you-will-need "Permanent link")

* **n8n**: For this tutorial we recommend using the [n8n cloud](/choose-n8n/cloud/) service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the [installation pages](/hosting/installation/docker/).
* **Credentials for a chat model**: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the [sub-nodes documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) for more).

### What you will learn[#](#what-you-will-learn "Permanent link")

* AI concepts in n8n
* How to use the AI Agent node
* Working with Chat input
* Connecting with AI models
* Customising input
* Observing the conversation
* Adding persistence

## AI concepts in n8n[#](#ai-concepts-in-n8n "Permanent link")

If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.

An AI agent builds on Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate text based
on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce
output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use tools, process
their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.

In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.

| Feature | LLM | AI Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Capability | Text generation | Goal-oriented task completion |
| Decision-Making | None | Yes |
| Uses Tools/APIs | No | Yes |
| Workflow Complexity | Single-step | Multi-step |
| Scope | Generates language | Performs complex, real-world tasks |
| Example | LLM generating a paragraph | An agent scheduling an appointment |

By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the *content* of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.

## 1. Create a new workflow[#](#1-create-a-new-workflow "Permanent link")

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

* An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
* The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the ![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** to create a new workflow.

## 2. Add a trigger node[#](#2-add-a-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called 'trigger nodes'. For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.

1. Select **Add first step** or press `Tab` to open the node menu.
2. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
4. Close the node details view (Select **Back to canvas**) to return to the canvas.

More about the Chat Trigger node...

The trigger node generates output when there is an event causing it to trigger. In this case we want to be able to type in text to cause the workflow to run. In production, this trigger can be hooked up to a public chat interface as provided by n8n or embedded into another website. To start this simple workflow we will just use the built-in local chat interface to communicate, so no further setup is required.


[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_01.json)
## 3. Add an AI Agent Node[#](#3-add-an-ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.

1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.
2. Start typing "AI" and choose the **AI agent** node to add it.
3. The editing view of the **AI agent** will now be displayed.
4. There are some fields which can be changed. For this tutorial, the default **Agent** should be left at the default (**Tools Agent**). As we are using the **Chat Trigger** node, the other default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_02.json)
## 4. Configure the node[#](#4-configure-the-node "Permanent link")

AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.

1. Add a chat model by clicking the plus ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) button underneath the **Chat Model** connection on the **AI Agent** node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).
2. The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use **OpenAI Chat Model**.
3. Selecting the **OpenAI Chat model** from the list will attach it to the **AI Agent** node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.

Which chat model?

As mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with.

## 5. Add credentials (if needed)[#](#5-add-credentials-if-needed "Permanent link")

In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some [credentials](/credentials/) (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.

![image showing the credentials dialog for OpenAI](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-credentials.png)

1. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear
   ![Screenshot showing create a new credential button](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-create-credential.png)
2. This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.
3. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the **API key** section.

Keeping your credentials safe

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

## 6. Test the node[#](#6-test-the-node "Permanent link")

Now that the node is connected to the **Chat Trigger** and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.

1. Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.
2. Type in a message and press `Enter`. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.
3. The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent.
   ![image showing a chat session in progress](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-chat.png)

Accessing the logs...

You can access the logs for the AI node even when you aren't using the chat interface. Open up the **AI Agent** node and click on the **Logs** tab in the right hand panel.
![screenshot showing the Logs tab in the AIAgent](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-logs.png)

## 7. Changing the prompt[#](#7-changing-the-prompt "Permanent link")

The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the **AI Agent** primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to "You are a helpful assistant". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.

1. Open the **AI Agent** node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'
2. The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like "You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets" for example.
3. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed.
   ![image showing changed text for chat, now it rhymes; if you can believe that](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-poet.png)

## 8. Adding persistence[#](#8-adding-persistence "Permanent link")

The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.

1. Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example "Hi there, my name is Nick".
2. Wait for the response, then type the message "What's my name?". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no memory.
   ![image showing a conversation illustrating the above](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-memory.png)
3. In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the **AI Agent** node. On the canvas click on the ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) on the bottom of the **AI Agent** node labeled "Memory".
4. From the panel which appears, select "Window Buffer Memory". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.
5. Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.

## 9. Saving the workflow[#](#9-saving-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.

1. Click on the "Save" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.

## Congratulations![#](#congratulations "Permanent link")

You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an **AI Agent** and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

# Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow[#](#retrieve-linked-items-from-earlier-in-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.

To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.

For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

1. The Customer Datastore node generates example data:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"id": "23423532", 		"name": "Jay Gatsby", 		"email": "gatsby@west-egg.com", 		"notes": "Keeps asking about a green light??", 		"country": "US", 		"created": "1925-04-10" 	}, 	{ 		"id": "23423533", 		"name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a", 		"email": "jab@macondo.co", 		"notes": "Lots of people named after him. Very confusing", 		"country": "CO", 		"created": "1967-05-05" 	}, 	... ]  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. The Edit Fields node simplifies this data:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"name": "Jay Gatsby" 	}, 	{ 		"name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a" 	},     ... ]  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. The Code node restore the email address to the correct person:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"name": "Jay Gatsby", 		"restoreEmail": "gatsby@west-egg.com" 	}, 	{ 		"name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a", 		"restoreEmail": "jab@macondo.co" 	}, 	... ]  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

The Code node does this using the following code:

JavaScriptPython

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` for(let i=0; i<$input.all().length; i++) { 	$input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = $('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email; } return $input.all();  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` for i,item in enumerate(_input.all()): 	_input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = _('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email  return _input.all();  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# getWorkflowStaticData | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/





[Skip to content](#getworkflowstaticdatatype)







# `getWorkflowStaticData(type)`[#](#getworkflowstaticdatatype "Permanent link")

This gives access to the static workflow data.

Experimental feature

* Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data.
* This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.

You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.

As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from
an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or
set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data
has changed and saves it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the
same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

JavaScriptPython

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` // Get the global workflow static data const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');  // Access its data const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;  // Update its data workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();  // Delete data delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` # Get the global workflow static data workflowStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('global')  # Access its data lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution  # Update its data workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()  # Delete data delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution  ``` |
| --- | --- |




Example with node data:

JavaScriptPython

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` // Get the static data of the node const nodeStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('node');  // Access its data const lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution;  // Update its data nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();  // Delete data delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution;  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` # Get the static data of the node nodeStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('node')  # Access its data lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution  # Update its data nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()  # Delete data delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution  ``` |

# Query JSON with JMESPath | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/





[Skip to content](#query-json-with-jmespath)







# Query JSON with JMESPath[#](#query-json-with-jmespath "Permanent link")

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

## The `jmespath()` method[#](#the-jmespath-method "Permanent link")

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

The basic syntax is:

JavaScriptPython

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $jmespath(object, searchString)  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` _jmespath(object, searchString)  ``` |
| --- | --- |




To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` var jmespath = require('jmespath'); jmespath.search(object, searchString);  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Expressions must be single-line

The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.

Search parameter order

The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.

## Common tasks[#](#common-tasks "Permanent link")

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections[#](#apply-a-jmespath-expression-to-a-collection-of-elements-with-projections "Permanent link")

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
> 
> * List Projections
> * Slice Projections
> * Object Projections
> * Flatten Projections
> * Filter Projections

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections) for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` [   {     "headers": {       "host": "n8n.instance.address",       ...     },     "params": {},     "query": {},     "body": {       "people": [         {           "first": "James",           "last": "Green"         },         {           "first": "Jacob",           "last": "Jones"         },         {           "first": "Jayden",           "last": "Smith"         }       ],       "dogs": {         "Fido": {           "color": "brown",           "age": 7         },         "Spot": {           "color": "black and white",           "age": 5         }       }     }   } ]  ``` |

### Select multiple elements and create a new list or object[#](#select-multiple-elements-and-create-a-new-list-or-object "Permanent link")

Use [Multiselect](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#multiselect) to select elements from a JSON object and combine them into a new list or object.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` [   {     "headers": {       "host": "n8n.instance.address",       ...     },     "params": {},     "query": {},     "body": {       "people": [         {           "first": "James",           "last": "Green"         },         {           "first": "Jacob",           "last": "Jones"         },         {           "first": "Jayden",           "last": "Smith"         }       ],       "dogs": {         "Fido": {           "color": "brown",           "age": 7         },         "Spot": {           "color": "black and white",           "age": 5         }       }     }   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Use multiselect list to get the first and last names and create new lists containing both names:


Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)Code node (Python)

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` {{$jmespath($json.body.people, "[].[first, last]")}} // Returns [["James","Green"],["Jacob","Jones"],["Jayden","Smith"]]  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` let newList = $jmespath($json.body.people, "[].[first, last]"); return {newList}; /* Returns: [ 	{ 		"newList": [ 			[ 				"James", 				"Green" 			], 			[ 				"Jacob", 				"Jones" 			], 			[ 				"Jayden", 				"Smith" 			] 		] 	} ] */  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` newList = _jmespath(_json.body.people, "[].[first, last]") return {"newList":newList} """ Returns: [ 	{ 		"newList": [ 			[ 				"James", 				"Green" 			], 			[ 				"Jacob", 				"Jones" 			], 			[ 				"Jayden", 				"Smith" 			] 		] 	} ] """  ``` |
| --- | --- |




### An alternative to arrow functions in expressions[#](#an-alternative-to-arrow-functions-in-expressions "Permanent link")

For example, generate some input data by returning the below code from the Code node:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ``` | ``` return[   {     "json": {             "num_categories": "0",       "num_products": "45",       "category_id": 5529735,       "parent_id": 1407340,       "pos_enabled": 1,       "pos_favorite": 0,       "name": "HP",       "description": "",       "image": ""     }   },   {     "json": {       "num_categories": "0",       "num_products": "86",       "category_id": 5529740,       "parent_id": 1407340,       "pos_enabled": 1,       "pos_favorite": 0,       "name": "Lenovo",       "description": "",       "image": ""     }   }   ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You could do a search like "find the item with the name Lenovo and tell me their category ID."

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{ $jmespath($("Code").all(), "[?json.name=='Lenovo'].json.category_id") }}  ``` |

# Date and time with Luxon[#](#date-and-time-with-luxon "Permanent link")

[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.

Python support

Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](#variables) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:

* You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.
* The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](#convert-date-string-to-luxon), isn't available for Python users.
## Variables[#](#variables "Permanent link")

n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:

* `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
* `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)Code node (Python)

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` {{$now}} // n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp // For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00 {{"Today's date is " + $now}} // n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>" // For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` $now // n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp> // For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00 let rightNow = "Today's date is " + $now // n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>" // For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` _now # n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp> # For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00 rightNow = "Today's date is " + str(_now) # n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>" # For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"  ``` |
| --- | --- |




n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

## Date and time behavior in n8n[#](#date-and-time-behavior-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Be aware of the following:

* In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
* With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

## Setting the timezone in n8n[#](#setting-the-timezone-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:

* Default: `America/New York`
* A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.
* A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.

## Common tasks[#](#common-tasks "Permanent link")

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

### Convert date string to Luxon[#](#convert-date-string-to-luxon "Permanent link")

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date

With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:[#](#if-you-have-a-date-in-a-supported-standard-technical-format "Permanent link")

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')  ``` |
| --- | --- |




Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:[#](#if-you-have-a-date-as-a-string-that-doesnt-use-a-standard-format "Permanent link")

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")  ``` |
| --- | --- |




When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations). If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging) guide.

### Get n days from today[#](#get-n-days-from-today "Permanent link")

Get a number of days before or after today.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.

In the expressions editor, enter:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$today.minus({days: 7})}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.


For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

In the code editor, enter:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})  ``` |
| --- | --- |

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.



For more detailed information and examples, refer to:

* Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)
* Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)

### Create human-readable dates[#](#create-human-readable-dates "Permanent link")

In [Get n days from today](#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: "yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.

For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.

This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()  ``` |
| --- | --- |




You can alter the format. For example:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".


| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})  ``` |
| --- | --- |

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".



Refer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans) for more information.

### Get the time between two dates[#](#get-the-time-between-two-dates "Permanent link")

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This returns `[Object: {"months":1}]`.


| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This returns `{"months":1}`.



Refer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs) for more information.

### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?[#](#a-longer-example-how-many-days-to-christmas "Permanent link")

This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.

The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the expression does:

* `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.
* `"There are "`: a string.
* `+`: used to join two strings.
* `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
* `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
* `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
* `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
* `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.
* `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` let daysToChristmas = "There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!";  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the code does:

* `"There are "`: a string.
* `+`: used to join two strings.
* `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
* `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure.

* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
* `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
* `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
* `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.

[Skip to content](#langchain-code-node-methods)







# LangChain Code node methods[#](#langchain-code-node-methods "Permanent link")

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the [LangChain Code node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/).

LangChain Code node only

These variables are for use in expressions in the LangChain Code node. You can't use them in other nodes.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `this.addInputData(inputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n. |
| `this.addOutputData(outputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.  * `outputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add.

| `this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)` | Get data from a specified non-main input.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `itemIndex` should always be `0` (this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality) * Use `inputIndex` if there is more than one node connected to the specified input. |
| `this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)` | Get data from the main input. |
| `this.getNode()` | Get the current node. |
| `this.getNodeOutputs()` | Get the outputs of the current node. |
| `this.getExecutionCancelSignal()` | Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the [Cancelling a running LLMChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain#cancelling-a-running-llmchain) code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally. |

# Using the Code node | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/





[Skip to content](#using-the-code-node)







# Using the Code node[#](#using-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](/code/) section. It includes:

* Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/)
* Guidance on [Handling dates](/code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](/code/cookbook/jmespath/)
* A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](/code/cookbook/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.


Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode[#](#choose-a-mode "Permanent link")

There are two modes:

* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript[#](#javascript "Permanent link")

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features[#](#supported-javascript-features "Permanent link")

The Code node supports:

* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries[#](#external-libraries "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

* [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
* [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts[#](#keyboard-shortcuts "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts).

## Python[#](#python "Permanent link")

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_1 "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts[#](#keyboard-shortcuts_1 "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts).

## File system and HTTP requests[#](#file-system-and-http-requests "Permanent link")

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n[#](#coding-in-n8n "Permanent link")

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts[#](#key-concepts "Permanent link")

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_2 "Permanent link")

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

* Accessing specific item data
* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
* Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node[#](#use-ai-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.


AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
3. Write your query.
4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

# CLI commands | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/





[Skip to content](#cli-commands-for-n8n)







# CLI commands for n8n[#](#cli-commands-for-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.

## Running CLI commands[#](#running-cli-commands "Permanent link")

You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:

* npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
* Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:
  
  | ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>  ``` |
  | --- | --- |

## Start a workflow[#](#start-a-workflow "Permanent link")

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.

Execute a saved workflow by its ID:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n execute --id <ID>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Change the active status of a workflow[#](#change-the-active-status-of-a-workflow "Permanent link")

You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

Restart required

These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=true  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Set the active status to false for all the workflows:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n update:workflow --all --active=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Set the active status to true for all the workflows:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n update:workflow --all --active=true  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Export workflows and credentials[#](#export-workflows-and-credentials "Permanent link")

You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Command flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --help | Help prompt. |
| --all | Exports all workflows/credentials. |
| --backup | Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output. |
| --id | The ID of the workflow to export. |
| --output | Outputs file name or directory if using separate files. |
| --pretty | Formats the output in an easier to read fashion. |
| --separate | Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output. |
| --decrypted | Exports the credentials in a plain text format. |

### Workflows[#](#workflows "Permanent link")

Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:workflow --all  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:workflow --id=<ID> --output=file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:workflow --all --output=backups/latest/file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:workflow --backup --output=backups/latest/  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Credentials[#](#credentials "Permanent link")

Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:credentials --all  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:credentials --id=<ID> --output=file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:credentials --all --output=backups/latest/file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:credentials --backup --output=backups/latest/  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.

Sensitive information

All sensitive information is visible in the files.


| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted --output=backups/decrypted.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Import workflows and credentials[#](#import-workflows-and-credentials "Permanent link")

You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Update the IDs

When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.

Available flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --help | Help prompt. |
| --input | Input file name or directory if you use --separate. |
| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |
| --separate | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input. |
| --userId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |

Migrating to SQLite

n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.

This might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.

In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.

### Workflows[#](#workflows_1 "Permanent link")

Import workflows from a specific file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n import:workflow --input=file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Import credentials from a specific file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n import:credentials --input=file.json  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n import:credentials --separate --input=backups/latest/  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## License[#](#license "Permanent link")

### Clear[#](#clear "Permanent link")

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n license:clear  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Info[#](#info "Permanent link")

Display information about the existing license:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n license:info  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## User management[#](#user-management "Permanent link")

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n user-management:reset  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Disable MFA for a user[#](#disable-mfa-for-a-user "Permanent link")

If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n mfa:disable --email=johndoe@example.com  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Disable LDAP[#](#disable-ldap "Permanent link")

You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n ldap:reset  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# Hardening task runners | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/hardening-task-runners/





[Skip to content](#hardening-task-runners)







# Hardening task runners[#](#hardening-task-runners "Permanent link")

[Task runners](/hosting/configuration/task-runners/) are responsible for executing code from the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/). While Code node executions are secure, you can follow these recommendations to further harden your task runners.

## Run task runners as sidecars in external mode[#](#run-task-runners-as-sidecars-in-external-mode "Permanent link")

To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in [external mode](/hosting/configuration/task-runners#setting-up-external-mode). External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node.

# Block access to nodes | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/





[Skip to content](#block-access-to-nodes)







# Block access to nodes[#](#block-access-to-nodes "Permanent link")

For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.

Use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.

## Exclude nodes[#](#exclude-nodes "Permanent link")

Update your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.

For example, setting the variable this way:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Blocks the [Execute Command](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.

Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.

## Suggested nodes to block[#](#suggested-nodes-to-block "Permanent link")

The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:

* [Execute Command](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
* [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)

# Set up SSL[#](#set-up-ssl "Permanent link")

There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)[#](#use-a-reverse-proxy-recommended "Permanent link")

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.

Refer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security) for more information.

## Pass certificates into n8n directly[#](#pass-certificates-into-n8n-directly "Permanent link")

You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.

You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.

# Memory-related errors | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/memory-errors/





[Skip to content](#memory-related-errors)







# Memory-related errors[#](#memory-related-errors "Permanent link")

n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.

Only for self-hosted n8n

This page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/). Visit [Cloud data management](/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/).

## Identifying out of memory situations[#](#identifying-out-of-memory-situations "Permanent link")

n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.

Error messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.

When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs.

On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.

## Typical causes[#](#typical-causes "Permanent link")

Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:

* Amount of [JSON data](/data/data-structure/).
* Size of binary data.
* Number of nodes in a workflow.
* Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
* Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
* Additional workflows running at the same time.

## Avoiding out of memory situations[#](#avoiding-out-of-memory-situations "Permanent link")

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory[#](#increase-available-memory "Permanent link")

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.

### Reduce memory consumption[#](#reduce-memory-consumption "Permanent link")

This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.

* Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
* Avoid using the Code node where possible.
* Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
* Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

### Increase old memory[#](#increase-old-memory "Permanent link")

This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).

# External storage for binary data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/external-storage/





[Skip to content](#external-storage)







# External storage[#](#external-storage "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans
* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data.

n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.

## Storing n8n's binary data in S3[#](#storing-n8ns-binary-data-in-s3 "Permanent link")

n8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.

Enterprise-tier feature

You will need an [Enterprise license key](/enterprise-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.

### Setup[#](#setup "Permanent link")

Create and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` { 	"Version": "2012-10-17", 	"Statement": [ 		{ 			"Sid": "VisualEditor0", 			"Effect": "Allow", 			"Action": ["s3:*"], 			"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>", "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"] 		} 	] }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.

Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...  ``` |
| --- | --- |


No region

If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`.

Tell n8n to store binary data in S3:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3 export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

### Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.

If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.

Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# Scaling binary data in n8n | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/binary-data/





[Skip to content](#binary-data)







# Binary data[#](#binary-data "Permanent link")

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents generated or processed during the execution of a workflow.

## Enable filesystem mode[#](#enable-filesystem-mode "Permanent link")

When handling binary data, n8n keeps the data in memory by default. This can cause crashes when working with large files.

To avoid this, change the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data) to `filesystem`. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory.

If you're using queue mode, keep this to `default`. n8n doesn't support filesystem mode with queue mode.

## Binary data pruning[#](#binary-data-pruning "Permanent link")

n8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to [Execution data | Enable data pruning](/hosting/scaling/execution-data/#enable-data-pruning) for details.

If you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. Refer to [External storage](/hosting/scaling/external-storage/#usage) for details.

# AI coding | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/





[Skip to content](#ai-coding-with-gpt)







# AI coding with GPT[#](#ai-coding-with-gpt "Permanent link")

Not available on self-hosted.

Python isn't supported.
///

## Use AI in the Code node[#](#use-ai-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.


AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
3. Write your query.
4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Usage limits[#](#usage-limits "Permanent link")

During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.

## Feature limits[#](#feature-limits "Permanent link")

The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:

* The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
* The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
* Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
* Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
* May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.

## Writing good prompts[#](#writing-good-prompts "Permanent link")

Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.

Some general tips:

* Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you‚Äôre aiming for.
* Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: "First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name."
* Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying "Get the older users," you might say "Filter users who are 60 years and above."
* Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.

And some n8n-specific guidance:

* Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
* Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. "Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: "Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node."
* Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.

### Example prompts[#](#example-prompts "Permanent link")

These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.

#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset[#](#example-1-find-a-piece-of-data-inside-a-second-dataset "Permanent link")

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the third Code node, enter this prompt:

> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` const slackUser = $("Mock Slack").all()[0]; const notionUsers = $input.all(); const slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email;  const notionUser = notionUsers.find(   (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail );  return notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Example 2: Data transformation[#](#example-2-data-transformation "Permanent link")

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/data-transformation.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Join items** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` const items = $input.all(); const usernames = items.map((item) => `"${item.json.username}"`); const result = usernames.join(", "); return [{ json: { usernames: result } }];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message[#](#example-3-summarize-data-and-create-a-slack-message "Permanent link")

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/summarize-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Summarize** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property\_type field. A feature has the property "Feature", a bug has the property "Bug" and an idea has the property "Bug". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use "" as markdown for links.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 ``` | ``` const submissions = $input.all();  // Count the number of ideas, features, and bugs let ideaCount = 0; let featureCount = 0; let bugCount = 0;  submissions.forEach((submission) => {   switch (submission.json.property_type[0]) {     case "Idea":       ideaCount++;       break;     case "Feature":       featureCount++;       break;     case "Bug":       bugCount++;       break;   } });  // Sort submissions by votes and take the top 5 const topSubmissions = submissions   .sort((a, b) => b.json.property_votes - a.json.property_votes)   .slice(0, 5);  let topSubmissionText = ""; topSubmissions.forEach((submission) => {   topSubmissionText += `<${submission.json.url}|${submission.json.name}> with ${submission.json.property_votes} votes\n`; });  // Construct the Slack message const slackMessage = `*Summary of Submissions*\n Ideas: ${ideaCount}\n Features: ${featureCount}\n Bugs: ${bugCount}\n Top 5 Submissions:\n ${topSubmissionText}`;  return [{ json: { slackMessage } }];  ``` |
| --- | --- |


### Reference incoming node data explicitly[#](#reference-incoming-node-data-explicitly "Permanent link")

If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

!["Screenshot of an n8n code node, highlighting how to reference data with dot notation in an AI query"](/_images/code/ai-code/reference-data-dot-notation.png)

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.

In the second Code node, enter this prompt:

> The data in "Mock data" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal\_info.first\_name and work\_info.job\_title.

This is the JavaScript you need:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` const items = $input.all(); const newItems = items.map((item) => {   const firstName = item.json.personal_info.first_name;   const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;   return {     json: {       firstName,       jobTitle,     },   }; }); return newItems;  ``` |

# Expressions | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/





[Skip to content](#expressions)







# Expressions[#](#expressions "Permanent link")

In version 1.9.0 n8n changed the templating language for expressions

If you have issues with expressions in 1.9.0:

* Please report the issue on the [forums](https://community.n8n.io/).
* Self-hosted users can switch back to RiotTmpl: set `N8N_EXPRESSION_EVALUATOR` to `tmpl`. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information on configuring self-hosted n8n.

Use expressions to set node parameters dynamically based on data from:

* Previous nodes
* The workflow
* Your n8n environment

You can execute JavaScript within an expression.

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](/code-examples/methods-variables-reference/) and [data transformation functions](/code-examples/expressions/data-transformation-functions/) that help with common tasks, such as retrieving data from other nodes, or accessing metadata.

n8n supports two libraries:

* [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with data and time.
* [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.

No Python support

Expressions must use JavaScript.


Data in n8n

When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](/data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.

## Writing expressions[#](#writing-expressions "Permanent link")

To use an expression to set a parameter value:

1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
2. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
3. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** ![Open expressions editor icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

### Example: Get data from webhook body[#](#example-get-data-from-webhook-body "Permanent link")

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` [   {     "headers": {       "host": "n8n.instance.address",       ...     },     "params": {},     "query": {},     "body": {       "name": "Jim",       "age": 30,       "city": "New York"     }   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$json.body.city}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This expression:

1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
2. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.

### Example: Writing longer JavaScript[#](#example-writing-longer-javascript "Permanent link")

An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.

To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression.

However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` // This example is split over multiple lines for readability // It's still invalid when formatted as a single line {{   function example() {     let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');     let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');     let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');     return diffInMonths.toObject();   }   example(); }}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

While the second example is valid:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# Database structure | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/architecture/database-structure/





[Skip to content](#database-structure)







# Database structure[#](#database-structure "Permanent link")

This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.

## Database and query technology[#](#database-and-query-technology "Permanent link")

By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.

n8n uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for queries and migrations.

To inspect the n8n database, you can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io), which is an open-source universal database tool.

# Execution data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/execution-data/





[Skip to content](#execution-data)







# Execution data[#](#execution-data "Permanent link")

Depending on your executions settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid this, n8n recommends that you don't save unnecessary data, and enable pruning of old executions data.

To do this, configure the corresponding [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions).

## Reduce saved data[#](#reduce-saved-data "Permanent link")

Configuration at workflow level

You can also configure these settings on an individual workflow basis using the [workflow settings](/workflows/workflows/#workflow-settings).

You can select which executions data n8n saves. For example, you can save only executions that result in an `Error`.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` # npm # Save executions ending in errors export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all  # Save successful executions export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=all  # Don't save node progress for each execution export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=false  # Don't save manually launched executions export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

| --- | --- |

## Enable data pruning[#](#enable-data-pruning "Permanent link")

You can enable data pruning to automatically delete finished executions after a given time. If you don't set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, 336 hours (14 days) is the default.

You can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, using `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records. This can help with database performance issues, especially if you use SQLite. The database size can still exceed the limit you set: old executions that haven't finished running don't get deleted, even if they would otherwise be subject to deletion.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` # npm # Activate automatic data pruning export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true  # Number of hours after execution that n8n deletes data export EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168  # Number of executions to store export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000  ``` |
| --- | --- |


| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` # Docker docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true \  -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |


| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` # Docker Compose n8n:     environment:       - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true       - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 	  	- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000  ``` |
| --- | --- |


SQLite

If you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation.


Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# Concurrency control | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/





[Skip to content](#self-hosted-concurrency-control)







# Self-hosted concurrency control[#](#self-hosted-concurrency-control "Permanent link")

Only for self-hosted n8n

This document is for self-hosted concurrency control. Read [Cloud concurrency](/manage-cloud/concurrency/) to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts.

In regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness.

To prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

Concurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Keep in mind:

* Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.
* You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
* On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

* To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI.

When you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Comparison to queue mode[#](#comparison-to-queue-mode "Permanent link")

In queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the [`--concurrency` flag](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#configure-worker-concurrency).

Concurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable `N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than `-1`, falling back to the `--concurrency` flag or its default.

# Monitoring | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/





[Skip to content](#monitoring)







# Monitoring[#](#monitoring "Permanent link")

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

## healthz and healthz/readiness[#](#healthz-and-healthzreadiness "Permanent link")

The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

Access the endpoint:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/healthz  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## metrics[#](#metrics "Permanent link")

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/metrics  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Feature availability

The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.


## Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n[#](#enable-metrics-and-healthz-for-self-hosted-n8n "Permanent link")

The `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # metrics N8N_METRICS=true # healthz QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# Logging | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/





[Skip to content](#logging-in-n8n)







# Logging in n8n[#](#logging-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library.

Log streaming

n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes [Log streaming](/log-streaming/), in addition to the logging options described in this document.

## Setup[#](#setup "Permanent link")

To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/))

| Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n8n.log.level | N8N\_LOG\_LEVEL | The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is `info`. You can learn more about these options [here](#log-levels). |
| n8n.log.output | N8N\_LOG\_OUTPUT | Where to output logs. The available options are `console` and `file`. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (`,`). `console` is used by default. |
| n8n.log.file.location | N8N\_LOG\_FILE\_LOCATION | The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, `<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log` is used. |
| n8n.log.file.maxsize | N8N\_LOG\_FILE\_SIZE\_MAX | The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB. |
| n8n.log.file.maxcount | N8N\_LOG\_FILE\_COUNT\_MAX | The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers. |

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` # Set the logging level to 'debug' export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug  # Set log output to both console and a log file export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file  # Set a save location for the log file export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log  # Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50  # Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Log levels[#](#log-levels "Permanent link")

n8n uses standard log levels to report:

* `silent`: outputs nothing at all
* `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
* `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
* `info`: contains useful information about progress
* `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.

## Development[#](#development "Permanent link")

During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.

### Implementation details[#](#implementation-details "Permanent link")

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.

Once the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.

Check the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.

### Adding logs[#](#adding-logs "Permanent link")

Once the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.

Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.

In the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` // You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier  import { 	LoggerProxy as Logger } from 'n8n-workflow';  // Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties  Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "${workflow.name}"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:

* Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
* Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
* Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.
* Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.

## Front-end logs[#](#front-end-logs "Permanent link")

As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.

# User management | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/user-management-self-hosted/





[Skip to content](#configure-self-hosted-n8n-for-user-management)







# Configure self-hosted n8n for user management[#](#configure-self-hosted-n8n-for-user-management "Permanent link")

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance.

This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.

Refer to the main [User management](/user-management/) guide for more information about usage, including:

* [Managing users](/user-management/manage-users/)
* [Account types](/user-management/account-types/)
* [Best practices](/user-management/best-practices/)

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/).

For SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](/user-management/saml/).

Basic auth and JWT removed

n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.

## Setup[#](#setup "Permanent link")

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
3. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP[#](#step-one-smtp "Permanent link")

n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.

Optional from 0.210.1

From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.

Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

* Server name
* SMTP username
* SMTP password
* SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/)

| Variable | Type | Description | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `N8N_EMAIL_MODE` | string | `smtp` | Required |
| `N8N_SMTP_HOST` | string | *your\_SMTP\_server\_name* | Required |
| `N8N_SMTP_PORT` | number | *your\_SMTP\_server\_port* Default is `465`. | Optional |
| `N8N_SMTP_USER` | string | *your\_SMTP\_username* | Optional |
| `N8N_SMTP_PASS` | string | *your\_SMTP\_password* | Optional |
| `N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_SERVICE_CLIENT` | string | *your\_OAuth\_service\_client* | Optional |
| `N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` | string | *your\_OAuth\_private\_key* | Optional |
| `N8N_SMTP_SENDER` | string | Sender email address. You can optionally include the sender name. Example with name: *N8N `<contact@n8n.com>`* | Required |
| `N8N_SMTP_SSL` | boolean | Whether to use SSL for SMTP (true) or not (false). Defaults to `true`. | Optional |
| `N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_INVITE` | string | Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for invite emails. | Optional |
| `N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_PWRESET` | string | Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for password reset emails. | Optional |
| `N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_WORKFLOW_SHARED` | String | Overrides the default HTML template for notifying users that a credential was shared. Provide the full path to the template. | Optional |
| `N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_CREDENTIALS_SHARED` | String | Overrides the default HTML template for notifying users that a credential was shared. Provide the full path to the template. | Optional |

If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings.

More configuration options

There are more configuration options available as environment variables. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them.


New to SMTP?

If you're not familiar with SMTP, this [blog post by SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) offers a short introduction, while [Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) provides more detailed technical background.

### Step two: In-app setup[#](#step-two-in-app-setup "Permanent link")

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
2. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
3. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

### Step three: Invite users[#](#step-three-invite-users "Permanent link")

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
2. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
3. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
4. Click **Invite**.
5. Enter the new user's email address.
6. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

[Skip to content](#enable-prometheus-metrics)







# Enable Prometheus metrics[#](#enable-prometheus-metrics "Permanent link")

To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the [prom-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client) library.

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the `N8N_METRICS` environment variable.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_METRICS=true  ``` |

[Skip to content](#configure-n8n-webhooks-with-reverse-proxy)







# Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy[#](#configure-n8n-webhooks-with-reverse-proxy "Permanent link")

n8n creates the webhook URL by combining `N8N_PROTOCOL`, `N8N_HOST` and `N8N_PORT`. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/  ``` |

[Skip to content](#enable-modules-in-code-node)







# Enable modules in Code node[#](#enable-modules-in-code-node "Permanent link")

For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:

# Configuring queue mode | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/





[Skip to content](#queue-mode)







# Queue mode[#](#queue-mode "Permanent link")

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.

Binary data storage

n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use [S3 external storage](../external-storage/).

## How it works[#](#how-it-works "Permanent link")

When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.

Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).

By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.

This is the process flow:

1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.
2. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.
3. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.
4. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.
5. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:
   * Writes the results to the database.
   * Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.
6. Redis notifies the main instance.

!["Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database"](/_images/hosting/scaling/queue-mode-flow.png)

## Configuring workers[#](#configuring-workers "Permanent link")

Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.

### Set encryption key[#](#set-encryption-key "Permanent link")

n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.

The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.

Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Set executions mode[#](#set-executions-mode "Permanent link")

Database considerations

n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.

Set the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` using the following command.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Alternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

### Start Redis[#](#start-redis "Permanent link")

Running Redis on a separate machine

You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.

To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:

Run the following command to start a Redis instance:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis  ``` |
| --- | --- |

By default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`. |
| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379` | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |

You can also set the following optional configurations:

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME` | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable. |
| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable. |
| `queue.bull.redis.db:0` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB` | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration. |
| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms). |
| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30` | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |

Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

### Start workers[#](#start-workers "Permanent link")

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` ./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.

#### Worker server[#](#worker-server "Permanent link")

Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:

* `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
* `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
* [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)
* [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

#### View running workers[#](#view-running-workers "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.

## Running n8n with queues[#](#running-n8n-with-queues "Permanent link")

When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.

Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.

Migrate data

If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.

## Webhook processors[#](#webhook-processors "Permanent link")

Keep in mind

Webhook processes rely on Redis too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.

Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.

This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.

n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.

You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` ./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Configure webhook URL[#](#configure-webhook-url "Permanent link")

To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can also set this value in the configuration file.

### Configure load balancer[#](#configure-load-balancer "Permanent link")

When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:

* Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool
* All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process

**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.

You can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.

### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)[#](#disable-webhook-processing-in-the-main-process-optional "Permanent link")

You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.

## Configure worker concurrency[#](#configure-worker-concurrency "Permanent link")

You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n worker --concurrency=5  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Concurrency and scaling recommendations[#](#concurrency-and-scaling-recommendations "Permanent link")

n8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures.

## Multi-main setup[#](#multi-main-setup "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

In queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.

In a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks:

* **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and
* **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.

In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:

* **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and
* the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.

### Leader designation[#](#leader-designation "Permanent link")

In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.

### Configuring multi-main setup[#](#configuring-multi-main-setup "Permanent link")

To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure:

* All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.
* All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.
* All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.
* All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.

If needed, you can adjust the leader key options:

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10` | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |
| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup. |

Keep in mind

In multi-main setup, all `main` processes listen for webhooks, so they fulfill the same purpose as `webhook` processes. Running `webhook` processes is neither needed nor allowed in multi-main setup.

# Performance and benchmarking | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/performance-benchmarking/





[Skip to content](#performance-and-benchmarking)







# Performance and benchmarking[#](#performance-and-benchmarking "Permanent link")

n8n can handle up to 220 workflow executions per second on a single instance, with the ability to scale up further by adding more instances.

This document outlines n8n's performance benchmarking. It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.

## Performance factors[#](#performance-factors "Permanent link")

The performance of n8n depends on factors including:

* The workflow type
* The resources available to n8n
* How you configure n8n's scaling options

## Run your own benchmarking[#](#run-your-own-benchmarking "Permanent link")

To get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark). The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.

## Example: Single instance performance[#](#example-single-instance-performance "Permanent link")

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

* Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)
* n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)
* Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node

![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-single-instance-100-250.png)

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.


## Example: Multi-instance performance[#](#example-multi-instance-performance "Permanent link")

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

* Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)
* n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis
* Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node
* Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/)

![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-multi-instance-500-2500.png)

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.

# Configure workflow timeout settings | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/execution-timeout/





[Skip to content](#configure-workflow-timeout-settings)







# Configure workflow timeout settings[#](#configure-workflow-timeout-settings "Permanent link")

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200  ``` |

# Set a custom encryption key | n8n Docs

[Skip to content](#set-a-custom-encryption-key)







# Set a custom encryption key[#](#set-a-custom-encryption-key "Permanent link")

n8n creates a random encryption key automatically on the first launch and saves
it in the `~/.n8n` folder. n8n uses that key to encrypt the credentials before
they get saved to the database. If the key isn't yet in the settings file,
you can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n
uses your custom key instead of generating a new one.

In [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>  ``` |

# Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate[#](#configure-n8n-to-use-your-own-certificate-authority-or-self-signed-certificate "Permanent link")

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

Available in version 1.42.0

This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container.

## Docker[#](#docker "Permanent link")

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

### Docker CLI[#](#docker-cli "Permanent link")

When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Docker Compose[#](#docker-compose "Permanent link")

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` name: n8n services:     n8n:         volumes:             - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates         container_name: n8n         ports:             - 5678:5678         image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates  ``` |

# Task runners | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/





[Skip to content](#task-runners)







# Task runners[#](#task-runners "Permanent link")

Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.

Experimental feature

Task runners are currently in public beta testing and might contain undiscovered issues. We don't recommend using them with business critical workflows.

## How it works[#](#how-it-works "Permanent link")

The task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester.

![Task runner overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)

Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.

The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.

The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.

## Task runner modes[#](#task-runner-modes "Permanent link")

You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.

### Internal mode[#](#internal-mode "Permanent link")

In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n.

### External mode[#](#external-mode "Permanent link")

In external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.

![Task runner deployed as a side-car container](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-external-mode.png)

In this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance.

When using the [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode), each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner.

## Setting up external mode[#](#setting-up-external-mode "Permanent link")

Use the following details to configure task runners in external mode

### Configuring n8n instance in external mode[#](#configuring-n8n-instance-in-external-mode "Permanent link")

You can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables:

| Environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` | Enables task runners. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external` | Use task runners in external mode. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` | By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections. |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/).

### Configuring task runners in external mode[#](#configuring-task-runners-in-external-mode "Permanent link")

The task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher.

The launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues.

Run a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties:

| Configuration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `command` | `["/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher", "javascript"]` |
| `livenessProbe` | `GET /healthz`, port `5680` |

Set the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs:

| Environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5` | The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679` | The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15` | Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to `0` to disable automatic shutdown. |
| `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit>` | The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner. |
| `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | The [same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/).

# Configuration methods | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/





[Skip to content](#configuration)







# Configuration[#](#configuration "Permanent link")

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line[#](#set-environment-variables-by-command-line "Permanent link")

### npm[#](#npm "Permanent link")

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal using the `export` command as shown below:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export <variable>=<value>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Docker[#](#docker "Permanent link")

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Set environment variables using a file[#](#set-environment-variables-using-a-file "Permanent link")

You can also configure n8n using a configuration file.

Only define the values that need to be different from the default in your configuration file. You can use multiple files. For example, you can have a file with generic base settings, and files with specific values for different environments.

### npm[#](#npm_1 "Permanent link")

Set the path to the JSON configuration file using the environment variable `N8N_CONFIG_FILES`:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` # Bash - Single file export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json # Bash - Multiple files are comma-separated export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json,/<path-to-config>/production.json  # PowerShell - Single file, persist for current user # Note that setting scope (Process, User, Machine) has no effect on Unix systems [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_CONFIG_FILES', '<path-to-config>\config.json', 'User')  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Example file:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {  "executions": {   "saveDataOnSuccess": "none"  },  "generic": {   "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"  },  "nodes": {   "exclude": "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\",\"n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\"]"  } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Formatting as JSON

You can't always work out the correct JSON from the [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/). For example, to set `N8N_METRICS` to `true`, you need to do:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` { 	"endpoints": { 		"metrics": { 			"enable": true 		} 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to the [Schema file in the source code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts) for full details of the expected settings.

### Docker[#](#docker_1 "Permanent link")

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

For example:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` n8n:     environment:       - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Keeping sensitive data in separate files[#](#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files "Permanent link")

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as credentials and database configuration. Here are some examples:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA_FILE=/path/to/credentials_data DB_TYPE_FILE=/path/to/db_type DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE=/path/to/database_name DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE=/path/to/database_host DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE=/path/to/database_port DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE=/path/to/database_user DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/database_password DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE=/path/to/database_schema DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE=/path/to/ssl_ca DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ssl_cert DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ssl_key DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_FILE=/path/to/ssl_reject_unauth  ``` |

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/updating/





[Skip to content](#update-self-hosted-n8n)







# Update self-hosted n8n[#](#update-self-hosted-n8n "Permanent link")

It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.

Some tips when updating:

* Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
* Check the [Release notes](/release-notes/) for breaking changes.
* Use [Environments](/source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.

For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:

* [Installed with npm](/hosting/installation/npm/)
* [Installed with Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/)

If you have already installed Docker and Docker-Compose, then you can start with step 4.

You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).


Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

### 1. Install Docker[#](#1-install-docker "Permanent link")

### 3. Install Docker-Compose[#](#3-install-docker-compose "Permanent link")

This can vary depending on the Linux distribution used. You can find detailed instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

The example below is for Ubuntu:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 4. DNS setup[#](#4-dns-setup "Permanent link")

Add A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` Type: A Name: n8n (or the desired subdomain) IP address: <IP_OF_YOUR_SERVER>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 5. Create Docker Compose file[#](#5-create-docker-compose-file "Permanent link")

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file. Paste the following in the file:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 ``` | ``` version: "3.7"  services:   traefik:     image: "traefik"     restart: always     command:       - "--api=true"       - "--api.insecure=true"       - "--providers.docker=true"       - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"       - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"       - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure"       - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entrypoint.scheme=https"       - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.tlschallenge=true"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.email=${SSL_EMAIL}"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"     ports:       - "80:80"       - "443:443"     volumes:       - traefik_data:/letsencrypt       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro    n8n:     image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n     restart: always     ports:       - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"     labels:       - traefik.enable=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}`)       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.entrypoints=web,websecure       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls.certresolver=mytlschallenge       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLRedirect=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSSeconds=315360000       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.browserXSSFilter=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.contentTypeNosniff=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.forceSTSHeader=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLHost=${DOMAIN_NAME}       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSIncludeSubdomains=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSPreload=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.middlewares=n8n@docker     environment:       - N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}       - N8N_PORT=5678       - N8N_PROTOCOL=https       - NODE_ENV=production       - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/       - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}     volumes:       - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n  volumes:   traefik_data:     external: true   n8n_data:     external: true  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you are planning on reading/writing local files with n8n (for example, by using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/), you will need to configure a data directory for those files here. If you are running n8n as a root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` - /local-files:/files  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you are running n8n as a non-root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` - /home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files:/files  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You will now be able to write files to the `/files` directory in n8n and they will appear on your server in either `/local-files` or `/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files`, respectively.

### 6. Create `.env` file[#](#6-create-env-file "Permanent link")

Create an `.env` file and change it accordingly.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` # The top level domain to serve from DOMAIN_NAME=example.com  # The subdomain to serve from SUBDOMAIN=n8n  # DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN combined decide where n8n will be reachable from # above example would result in: https://n8n.example.com  # Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron-Node by default # If not set New York time will be used GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin  # The email address to use for the SSL certificate creation SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 7. Create data folder[#](#7-create-data-folder "Permanent link")

Create the Docker volume that's defined as `n8n_data`. n8n will save the database file from SQLite and the encryption key in this volume.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker volume create n8n_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Create a volume for the Traefik data, This is defined as `traefik_data`.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker volume create traefik_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 8. Start Docker Compose[#](#8-start-docker-compose "Permanent link")

n8n can now be started via:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker compose up -d  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To stop the container:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker compose stop  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### 9. Done[#](#9-done "Permanent link")

n8n will now be reachable using the above defined subdomain + domain combination.
The above example would result in: `https://n8n.example.com`

n8n will only be reachable using `https` and not using `http`.

Secure your n8n instance

Make sure that you [set up authentication](/hosting/user-management/) for your n8n instance.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/google-cloud/





[Skip to content](#hosting-n8n-on-google-cloud)







# Hosting n8n on Google Cloud[#](#hosting-n8n-on-google-cloud "Permanent link")

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud (GCP). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
* The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) (install the gcloud CLI first)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).


Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Hosting options[#](#hosting-options "Permanent link")

Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) instead to undertake all the steps.

## Create project[#](#create-project "Permanent link")

GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.

## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API[#](#enable-the-kubernetes-engine-api "Permanent link")

GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for "Kubernetes" in the top search bar and select "Kubernetes Engine" from the results.

Select **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.

## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster "Permanent link")

From the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview), select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the "Standard" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an "Autopilot" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.

## Set Kubectl context[#](#set-kubectl-context "Permanent link")

The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.

## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository "Permanent link")

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/gcp) locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.

Clone the repository with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure Postgres[#](#configure-postgres "Permanent link")

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Create a volume for persistent storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-persistent-storage "Permanent link")

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ allowedTopologies:   - matchLabelExpressions:       - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone         values:           - us-central1-b           - us-central1-c  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Postgres environment variables[#](#postgres-environment-variables "Permanent link")

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n "Permanent link")

### Create a volume for file storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-file-storage "Permanent link")

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ volumes:   - name: n8n-claim0     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: n8n-claim0 ‚Ä¶  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Pod resources[#](#pod-resources "Permanent link")

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ resources:   requests:     memory: "250Mi"   limits:     memory: "500Mi" ‚Ä¶      ``` |
| --- | --- |

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

* **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables[#](#optional-environment-variables "Permanent link")

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments[#](#deployments "Permanent link")

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

* Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
* Define the container image to use
* Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
* The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
* Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services[#](#services "Permanent link")

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster[#](#send-to-kubernetes-cluster "Permanent link")

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl apply -f .  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml  ``` |
| --- | --- |


## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns "Permanent link")

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.

GKE and IP addresses

[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records) for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.

## Delete resources[#](#delete-resources "Permanent link")

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl delete -f .  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* Learn more about [configuring](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.
* Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](/try-it-out/).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Hosting options[#](#hosting-options "Permanent link")

Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.

## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service[#](#open-the-azure-kubernetes-service "Permanent link")

From [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select **Kubernetes services**.

## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster "Permanent link")

From the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.

## Set Kubectl context[#](#set-kubectl-context "Permanent link")

The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.

## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository "Permanent link")

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/azure). The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd azure  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure Postgres[#](#configure-postgres "Permanent link")

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage[#](#configure-volume-for-persistent-storage "Permanent link")

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

Specialized storage classes

If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes).

### Postgres environment variables[#](#postgres-environment-variables "Permanent link")

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n "Permanent link")

### Create a volume for file storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-file-storage "Permanent link")

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ volumes:   - name: n8n-claim0     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: n8n-claim0 ‚Ä¶  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Pod resources[#](#pod-resources "Permanent link")

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

| --- | --- |

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

* **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables[#](#optional-environment-variables "Permanent link")

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments[#](#deployments "Permanent link")

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

* Send the environment variables defined to each application pod

# Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services[#](#hosting-n8n-on-amazon-web-services "Permanent link")

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Hosting options[#](#hosting-options "Permanent link")

AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io).

While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster "Permanent link")

Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This can take a while to create the cluster.

Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.

## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository "Permanent link")

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/aws). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure Postgres[#](#configure-postgres "Permanent link")

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage[#](#configure-volume-for-persistent-storage "Permanent link")

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/general-purpose.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ spec:   storageClassName: gp2   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce ‚Ä¶  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Postgres environment variables[#](#postgres-environment-variables "Permanent link")

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n "Permanent link")

### Create a volume for file storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-file-storage "Permanent link")

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ volumes:   - name: n8n-claim0     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: n8n-claim0 ‚Ä¶  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Pod resources[#](#pod-resources "Permanent link")

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` ‚Ä¶ resources:   requests:     memory: "250Mi"   limits:     memory: "500Mi" ‚Ä¶      ``` |
| --- | --- |

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

* **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
* **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables[#](#optional-environment-variables "Permanent link")

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments[#](#deployments "Permanent link")

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

* Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
* Define the container image to use
* Set resource consumption limits
* The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
* Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services[#](#services "Permanent link")

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster[#](#send-to-kubernetes-cluster "Permanent link")

Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl apply -f .  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml  ``` |
| --- | --- |


## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns "Permanent link")

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.

To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:

1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.
2. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
3. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.
4. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.

Use HTTP

This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an "HTTPS" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.

## Delete resources[#](#delete-resources "Permanent link")

If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kubectl delete -f .  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# Hetzner | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/hetzner/





[Skip to content](#hosting-n8n-on-hetzner-cloud)







# Hosting n8n on Hetzner cloud[#](#hosting-n8n-on-hetzner-cloud "Permanent link")

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a Hetzner cloud server. It uses:

* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).


Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Create a server[#](#create-a-server "Permanent link")

1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
2. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.
3. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select "Docker CE" from the **APPS** tab.

Type

When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.


SSH keys

Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.

## Log in to your server[#](#log-in-to-your-server "Permanent link")

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg) for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.

## Install Docker Compose[#](#install-docker-compose "Permanent link")

The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` apt update && apt -y upgrade apt install docker-compose-plugin  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository "Permanent link")

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd n8n-docker-caddy  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Default folders and files[#](#default-folders-and-files "Permanent link")

The host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

* `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
* `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volume[#](#create-docker-volume "Permanent link")

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker volume create caddy_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker volume create n8n_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns "Permanent link")

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

## Open ports[#](#open-ports "Permanent link")

n8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` nano .env  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file[#](#the-docker-compose-file "Permanent link")

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

* The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
* The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` nano docker-compose.yml  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure Caddy[#](#configure-caddy "Permanent link")

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` nano caddy_config/Caddyfile  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Change the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {     reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {       flush_interval -1     } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Start Docker Compose[#](#start-docker-compose "Permanent link")

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker compose up -d  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup[#](#test-your-setup "Permanent link")

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy[#](#stop-n8n-and-caddy "Permanent link")

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker compose stop  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Updating[#](#updating "Permanent link")

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` # Pull latest version docker compose pull  # Stop and remove older version docker compose down  # Start the container docker compose up -d  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

# Heroku | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/heroku/





[Skip to content](#hosting-n8n-on-heroku)







# Hosting n8n on Heroku[#](#hosting-n8n-on-heroku "Permanent link")

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.
* [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres) to host n8n's data storage.
* A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).


Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project[#](#use-the-deployment-template-to-create-a-heroku-project "Permanent link")

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku/tree/main)

This opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.

### Configure environment variables[#](#configure-environment-variables "Permanent link")

Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.

You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:

* **N8N\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.
* **WEBHOOK\_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.

### Deploy n8n[#](#deploy-n8n "Permanent link")

Select **Deploy app**.

After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.

Heroku and DNS

Refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.

## Changing the deployment template[#](#changing-the-deployment-template "Permanent link")

You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.

### The Dockerfile[#](#the-dockerfile "Permanent link")

By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.

### Heroku and exposing ports[#](#heroku-and-exposing-ports "Permanent link")

Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.

Docker limitations with Heroku

[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.

### Configuring Heroku[#](#configuring-heroku "Permanent link")

The `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:

* `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
* The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* Learn more about [configuring](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.
* Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](/try-it-out/).

[Skip to content](#hosting-n8n-on-digitalocean)







# Hosting n8n on DigitalOcean[#](#hosting-n8n-on-digitalocean "Permanent link")

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a DigitalOcean droplet. It uses:

* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Create a Droplet[#](#create-a-droplet "Permanent link")

1. [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to DigitalOcean.
2. Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/).
3. In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu.
4. [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) available on the **Marketplace** tab.

Droplet resources

When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.


SSH key or Password

DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.

## Log in to your Droplet and create new user[#](#log-in-to-your-droplet-and-create-new-user "Permanent link")

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) for more information.

You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:

1. Log in as root.
2. Create a new user:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` adduser <username>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.
4. Grant the new user administrative privileges:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` usermod -aG sudo <username>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
   
   
   You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.
5. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended).
6. Log out of the droplet.
7. Log in using SSH as the new user.

## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository "Permanent link")

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd n8n-docker-caddy  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Default folders and files[#](#default-folders-and-files "Permanent link")

The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

* `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
* `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volumes[#](#create-docker-volumes "Permanent link")

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker volume create caddy_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker volume create n8n_data  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns "Permanent link")

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain.

| --- | --- |

If you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` automate.example.com {     reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {       flush_interval -1     } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Start Docker Compose[#](#start-docker-compose "Permanent link")

# npm | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/





[Skip to content](#npm)







# npm[#](#npm "Permanent link")

npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Try n8n with npx[#](#try-n8n-with-npx "Permanent link")

You can try n8n without installing it using npx.

From the terminal, run:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npx n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening <http://localhost:5678>.

## Install globally with npm[#](#install-globally-with-npm "Permanent link")

To install n8n globally, use npm:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install n8n -g  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install -g n8n@0.126.1  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To install `next`:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install -g n8n@next  ``` |
| --- | --- |

After the installation, start n8n by running:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` n8n # or n8n start  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Keep in mind

Windows users remember to change into the `.n8n` directory of your Home folder (`~/.n8n`) before running `n8n start`.

### Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](/try-it-out/).

## Updating[#](#updating "Permanent link")

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm update -g n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To install the `next` version:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install -g n8n@next  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## n8n with tunnel[#](#n8n-with-tunnel "Permanent link")

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To be able to use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n has a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which redirects requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n start --tunnel  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Reverting an upgrade[#](#reverting-an-upgrade "Permanent link")

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
2. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting[#](#windows-troubleshooting "Permanent link")

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

# Install private nodes | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/install-private-nodes/





[Skip to content](#install-private-nodes)







# Install private nodes[#](#install-private-nodes "Permanent link")

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance[#](#install-your-node-in-a-docker-n8n-instance "Permanent link")

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).
   
   Your Dockerfile should look like this:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` FROM node:16-alpine  ARG N8N_VERSION  RUN if [ -z "$N8N_VERSION" ] ; then echo "The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!" ; exit 1; fi  # Update everything and install needed dependencies RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec  # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root USER root  # Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly. RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \ 	npm config set python "$(which python3)" && \ 	npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \ 	apk del build-dependencies \ 	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;   # Install fonts RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \ 	update-ms-fonts && \ 	fc-cache -f && \ 	apk del fonts && \ 	find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \ 	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root  ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu  WORKDIR /data  COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]  EXPOSE 5678/tcp  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.
3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.
4. Build your Docker image:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number.  # For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0 docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance[#](#install-your-node-in-a-global-n8n-instance "Permanent link")

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.

# Submit community nodes | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/





[Skip to content](#submit-community-nodes)







# Submit community nodes[#](#submit-community-nodes "Permanent link")

Subject to change

The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

* View the [starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for some examples.
* Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/).
* Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

## Standards[#](#standards "Permanent link")

To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:

* Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
* Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
* Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute. Refer to the [package.json in the starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/package.json) for an example.
* Check your node using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) and test it locally to ensure it works.
* Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

# Node linter | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/





[Skip to content](#n8n-node-linter)







# n8n node linter[#](#n8n-node-linter "Permanent link")

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

## Setup[#](#setup "Permanent link")

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS%20Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

Don't edit the configuration file

[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

### Linting[#](#linting "Permanent link")

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

* Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console.
* Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

### Exceptions[#](#exceptions "Permanent link")

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.

# Run your node locally | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/





[Skip to content](#run-your-node-locally)







# Run your node locally[#](#run-your-node-locally "Permanent link")

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install n8n -g  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In your node directory npm run build npm link  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
   
   
   Check your directory
   
   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
   
   * `~/.n8n/custom/`
   * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.
4. Start n8n:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n start  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
   
   Node names
   
   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

* There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom  cd custom  npm init  ``` |

# Item linking | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items/





[Skip to content](#item-linking)







# Item linking[#](#item-linking "Permanent link")

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { 	"json": { . . . }, 	"pairedItem": { 		"item": item.pairedItem, 		// Optional: choose the input to use 		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs 		"input": 0 };  // Or set the index manually newItem = { 		"json": { . . . } 		"pairedItem": { 			"item": i, 			// Optional: choose the input to use 			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs 			"input": 0 		}, };  ``` |

# HTTP request helpers | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/





[Skip to content](#http-request-helper-for-node-builders)







# HTTP request helper for node builders[#](#http-request-helper-for-node-builders "Permanent link")

n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.

Programmatic style only

The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

Call the helper inside the `execute` function.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` // If no auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);  // If auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call( 	this,  	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi 	options, );  ``` |
| --- | --- |

`options` is an object:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` { 	url: string; 	headers?: object; 	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD'; 	body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams; 	qs?: object; 	arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma'; 	auth?: { 		username: string, 		password: string, 	}; 	disableFollowRedirect?: boolean; 	encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream'; 	skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean; 	returnFullResponse?: boolean; 	proxy?: { 		host: string; 		port: string | number; 		auth?: { 			username: string; 			password: string; 		}, 		protocol?: string; 	}; 	timeout?: number; 	json?: boolean; }	  ``` |
| --- | --- |

`url` is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.

Some notes about the possible fields:

* `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* `headers`: a key-value pair.
  + If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.
  + If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  + To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.
* `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.
  + `indices` (default): `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`
  + `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`
  + `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`
  + `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`
* `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.
* `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
* `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
* `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
* `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.

## Example[#](#example "Permanent link")

For an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts).

## Deprecation of the previous helper[#](#deprecation-of-the-previous-helper "Permanent link")

The previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.

To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.

If you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues).

## Migration guide to the new helper[#](#migration-guide-to-the-new-helper "Permanent link")

The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.

New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:

* Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.
* `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.
* `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`
* Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.
* `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior

# Credentials files | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/





[Skip to content](#credentials-file)







# Credentials file[#](#credentials-file "Permanent link")

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file[#](#structure-of-the-credentials-file "Permanent link")

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

1. Import statements
2. Create a class for the credentials
3. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

### Outline structure[#](#outline-structure "Permanent link")

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ``` | ``` import { 	IAuthenticateGeneric, 	ICredentialTestRequest, 	ICredentialType, 	INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class ExampleNode implements ICredentialType { 	name = 'exampleNodeApi'; 	displayName = 'Example Node API'; 	documentationUrl = ''; 	properties: INodeProperties[] = [ 		{ 			displayName: 'API Key', 			name: 'apiKey', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 	]; 	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 		type: 'generic', 		properties: {     		// Can be body, header, qs or auth 			qs: {         		// Use the value from `apiKey` above 				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}' 			}  		}, 	}; 	test: ICredentialTestRequest = { 		request: { 			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}', 			url: '/bearer', 		}, 	}; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Parameters[#](#parameters "Permanent link")

### `name`[#](#name "Permanent link")

String. The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

### `displayName`[#](#displayname "Permanent link")

String. The name n8n uses in the GUI.

### `documentationUrl`[#](#documentationurl "Permanent link")

String. URL to your credentials documentation.

### `properties`[#](#properties "Permanent link")

Each object contains:

* `displayName`: the name n8n uses in the GUI.
* `name`: the internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
* `type`: the data type expected, such as `string`.
* `default`: the URL that n8n should use to test credentials.

### `authenticate`[#](#authenticate "Permanent link")

* `authenticate`: Object. Contains objects that tell n8n how to inject the authentication data as part of the API request.

#### `type`[#](#type "Permanent link")

String. If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`.

#### `properties`[#](#properties_1 "Permanent link")

Object. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:

* `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.
  
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 	type: 'generic', 	properties: { 		body: { 			username: '={{$credentials.username}}', 			password: '={{$credentials.password}}', 		}, 	}, };  ``` |
  | --- | --- |
* `header`: Object. Send authentication data in the request header.
  
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 	type: 'generic', 	properties: { 		header: { 			Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.authToken}}', 		}, 	}, };  ``` |
  | --- | --- |
* `qs`: Object. Stands for "query string." Send authentication data in the request query string.
  
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 	type: 'generic', 	properties: { 		qs: { 			token: '={{$credentials.token}}', 		}, 	}, };  ``` |
  | --- | --- |
* `auth`: Object. Used for Basic Auth. Requires `username` and `password` as the key names.
  
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 	type: 'generic', 	properties: { 		auth: { 			username: '={{$credentials.username}}', 			password: '={{$credentials.password}}', 		}, 	}, };  ``` |
  | --- | --- |

### `test`[#](#test "Permanent link")

Provide a `request` object containing a URL and authentication type that n8n can use to test the credential.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` test: ICredentialTestRequest = { 		request: { 			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}', 			url: '/bearer', 		}, 	};  ``` |

# Codex files | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/





[Skip to content](#node-codex-files)







# Node codex files[#](#node-codex-files "Permanent link")

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json) file in the n8n starter.

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `node` | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`. |
| `nodeVersion` | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `"1.0"`. |
| `codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `"1.0"`. |
| `categories` | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See [Node categories](#node-categories) for more information. |
| `resources` | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI. |

## Node categories[#](#node-categories "Permanent link")

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

* Data & Storage
* Finance & Accounting
* Marketing & Content
* Productivity
* Miscellaneous
* Sales
* Development
* Analytics
* Communication
* Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.

# Programmatic-style execute() method | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/





[Skip to content](#programmatic-style-execute-method)







# Programmatic-style execute() method[#](#programmatic-style-execute-method "Permanent link")

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

Paired items

You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items/).

# Docker | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/





[Skip to content](#docker-installation)







# Docker Installation[#](#docker-installation "Permanent link")

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) offers the following advantages:

* Install n8n in a clean environment.
* Easier setup for your preferred database.
* Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system.

You can also use n8n in Docker with [Docker Compose](/hosting/installation/server-setups/docker-compose/). You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Before proceeding, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Linux Users

Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) individually for your distribution.


Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).


Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.77.3  

Current `next`: 1.78.0

## Starting n8n[#](#starting-n8n "Permanent link")

From your terminal, run:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This command will download all required n8n images and start your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.

You can then access n8n by opening:
<http://localhost:5678>

## Using alternate databases[#](#using-alternate-databases "Permanent link")

By default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB configurable using environment variables as detailed below.

It's important to still persist data in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder as it contains n8n user data and even more importantly the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when the n8n tunnel is used.

If no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on
startup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore.

Keep in mind

Persisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required. The encryption key can be provided using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

### PostgresDB[#](#postgresdb "Permanent link")

To use n8n with Postgres, provide the corresponding:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

A complete `docker-compose` file for Postgres can be found [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).

## Setting timezone[#](#setting-timezone "Permanent link")

To define the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can be set. This gets used by schedule based nodes such as the Cron node.

The timezone of the system can also be set separately. This controls what
some scripts and commands return like `$ date`. The system timezone can be set using the environment variable `TZ`.

Example using the same timezone for both:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \  -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Updating[#](#updating "Permanent link")

From your Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

![Docker Desktop](/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` # Pull latest (stable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  # Pull specific version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:0.220.1  # Pull next (unstable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Stop the container and start it again. You can also use the command line:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` # Get the container ID docker ps -a  # Stop the container with ID container_id docker stop [container_id]  # Remove the container with ID container_id docker rm [container_id]  # Start the container docker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Docker Compose[#](#docker-compose "Permanent link")

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` # Pull latest version docker compose pull  # Stop and remove older version docker compose down  # Start the container docker compose up -d  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Further reading[#](#further-reading "Permanent link")

More information about Docker setup can be found in the README file of the [Docker Image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).

## n8n with tunnel[#](#n8n-with-tunnel "Permanent link")

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To be able to use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n has a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which redirects requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \  start --tunnel  ``` |
| --- | --- |

# Programmatic-style parameters[#](#programmatic-style-parameters "Permanent link")

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `defaultVersion`[#](#defaultversion "Permanent link")

*Number* | *Optional*

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`[#](#methods-and-loadoptions "Permanent link")

*Object* | *Optional*

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ``` | ``` 	methods = { 		loadOptions: { 			// Get all the labels and display them 			async getLabels( 				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions, 			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> { 				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = []; 				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call( 					this, 					'labels', 					'GET', 					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels', 				); 				for (const label of labels) { 					const labelName = label.name; 					const labelId = label.id; 					returnData.push({ 						name: labelName, 						value: labelId, 					}); 				} 				return returnData; 			}, 		}, 	};  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## `version`[#](#version "Permanent link")

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.

# Declarative-style parameters[#](#declarative-style-parameters "Permanent link")

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/).

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`[#](#methods-and-loadoptions "Permanent link")

*Object* | *Optional*

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` methods : { 	loadOptions: { 		routing: { 			request: { 				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters', 				method: 'GET', 			}, 			output: { 				postReceive: [ 					{ 						// When the returned data is nested under another property 						// Specify that property key 						type: 'rootProperty', 						properties: { 							property: 'responseData', 						}, 					}, 					{ 						type: 'setKeyValue', 						properties: { 							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})', 							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}', 						}, 					}, 					{ 						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key 						type: 'sort', 						properties: { 							key: 'name', 						}, 					}, 				], 			}, 		}, 	} },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## `routing`[#](#routing "Permanent link")

*Object* | *Required*

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` description: INodeTypeDescription = {   // Other node info here   requestDefaults: { 			baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov', 			url: '', 			headers: { 				Accept: 'application/json', 				'Content-Type': 'application/json', 			}, 		},     properties: [       // Resources here       {         displayName: 'Operation'         // Other operation details         options: [           {             name: 'Get'             value: 'get',             description: '',             routing: {               request: {                 method: 'GET',                 url: '/planetary/apod'               }             }           }         ]       }     ] }  ``` |
| --- | --- |


## `version`[#](#version "Permanent link")

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.

# Standard parameters | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/





[Skip to content](#standard-parameters)







# Standard parameters[#](#standard-parameters "Permanent link")

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/). They're the same for all node types.

## `displayName`[#](#displayname "Permanent link")

*String* | *Required*

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

## `name`[#](#name "Permanent link")

*String* | *Required*

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

## `icon`[#](#icon "Permanent link")

*String* or *Object* | *Required*

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes.
If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'  ``` |
| --- | --- |


To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` icon: {    light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg',    dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg'  }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

## `group`[#](#group "Permanent link")

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

* `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
* `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
* `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
* An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

## `description`[#](#description "Permanent link")

*String* | *Required*

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

## `defaults`[#](#defaults "Permanent link")

*Object* | *Required*

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

* `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
* `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`[#](#forceinputnodeexecution "Permanent link")

*Boolean* | *Optional*

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

## `inputs`[#](#inputs "Permanent link")

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.

## `outputs`[#](#outputs "Permanent link")

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

## `requiredInputs`[#](#requiredinputs "Permanent link")

*Integer* or *Array* | *Optional*

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

## `credentials`[#](#credentials "Permanent link")

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

* `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'` in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts) links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).
* `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

## `requestDefaults`[#](#requestdefaults "Permanent link")

*Object* | *Required*

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

* `baseURL`: The API base URL.

You can also add:

* `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
* `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

## `properties`[#](#properties "Permanent link")

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

### Resource objects[#](#resource-objects "Permanent link")

A resource object includes the following parameters:

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`.

### Operations objects[#](#operations-objects "Permanent link")

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
* `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
  + `name`. String.
  + `value`. String.
  + `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `"Card"` and an operation `"Get all"`, your action is `"Get all cards"`.
  + `description`: String.
  + `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects[#](#additional-fields-objects "Permanent link")

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` displayName: 'Additional Fields', name: 'additionalFields', // The UI element type type: '' placeholder: 'Add Field', default: {}, displayOptions: {   // Set which resources and operations this field is available for   show: {     resource: [       // Resource names     ],     operation: [       // Operation names     ]   }, }  ``` |

# Structure of the node base file[#](#structure-of-the-node-base-file "Permanent link")

The node base file follows this basic structure:

1. Add import statements.
2. Create a class for the node.
3. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node[#](#outline-structure-for-a-declarative-style-node "Permanent link")

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class ExampleNode implements INodeType { 	description: INodeTypeDescription = { 		// Basic node details here 		properties: [ 			// Resources and operations here 		] 	}; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

* Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
* Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI[#](#node-icon-doesnt-show-up-in-the-add-node-menu-and-the-editor-ui "Permanent link")

* Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
* Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
* When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit[#](#node-icon-doesnt-fit "Permanent link")

* If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
* If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu[#](#node-doesnt-show-up-in-the-add-node-menu "Permanent link")

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing[#](#changes-to-the-description-properties-dont-show-in-the-ui-on-refreshing "Permanent link")

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` + `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case[#](#linter-incorrectly-warning-about-file-name-case "Permanent link")

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files.

# Node base file | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/





[Skip to content](#node-base-file)







# Node base file[#](#node-base-file "Permanent link")

The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

* [Structure of the node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/structure/)
* [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/)

For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Declarative-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters/)

For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Programmatic-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters/)

# Versioning | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/





[Skip to content](#node-versioning)







# Node versioning[#](#node-versioning "Permanent link")

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

* If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
* When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

Versioning type restricted by node style

If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.

## Light versioning[#](#light-versioning "Permanent link")

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:

1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.
2. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` {     displayName: 'NASA Pics',     name: 'NasaPics',     icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',     // List the available versions     version: [1,2,3],     // More basic parameters here     properties: [         // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2         {             displayName: 'Resource name',             // More resource parameters             displayOptions: {                 show: {                     '@version': 2,                 },             },         },     ], }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Full versioning[#](#full-versioning "Permanent link")

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).

Full versioning summary:

* The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
* The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
* n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.

# Code standards | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/code-standards/





[Skip to content](#code-standards)







# Code standards[#](#code-standards "Permanent link")

Following defined code standards when building your node makes your code more readable and maintainable, and helps avoid errors. This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/).

## Use the linter[#](#use-the-linter "Permanent link")

The n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) documentation for more information.

## Use the starter[#](#use-the-starter "Permanent link")

The n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).

## Write in TypeScript[#](#write-in-typescript "Permanent link")

All n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a node[#](#detailed-guidelines-for-writing-a-node "Permanent link")

These guidelines apply to any node you build.

### Resources and operations[#](#resources-and-operations "Permanent link")

If your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation `Operation`. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 ``` | ``` export const ExampleNode implements INodeType {     description: {         displayName: 'Example Node',         ...         properties: [             {                 displayName: 'Resource',                 name: 'resource',                 type: 'options',                 options: [                     {                         name: 'Resource One',                         value: 'resourceOne'                     },                     {                         name: 'Resource Two',                         value: 'resourceTwo'                     }                 ],                 default: 'resourceOne'             },             {                 displayName: 'Operation',                 name: 'operation',                 type: 'options',                 // Only show these operations for Resource One                 displayOptions: {                     show: {                         resource: [                             'resourceOne'                         ]                     }                 },                 options: [                     {                         name: 'Create',                         value: 'create',                         description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'                     }                 ]             }         ]     } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Reuse internal parameter names[#](#reuse-internal-parameter-names "Permanent link")

All resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations.

For example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.

When reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node[#](#detailed-guidelines-for-writing-a-programmatic-style-node "Permanent link")

These guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).

### Don't change incoming data[#](#dont-change-incoming-data "Permanent link")

Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.

It's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.

### Use the built in request library[#](#use-the-built-in-request-library "Permanent link")

Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` // If no auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);  // If auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call( 	this,  	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi 	options, );  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

Refer to [HTTP helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`.

# Tutorial: Build a programmatic-style node | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/





[Skip to content](#build-a-programmatic-style-node)







# Build a programmatic-style node[#](#build-a-programmatic-style-node "Permanent link")

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

* JavaScript/TypeScript
* REST APIs
* git
* Expressions in n8n

## Build your node[#](#build-your-node "Permanent link")

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project[#](#step-1-set-up-the-project "Permanent link")

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
   
   | ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`  

`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`  

`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`  

`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm i  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Step 2: Add an icon[#](#step-2-add-an-icon "Permanent link")

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg) as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Define the node in the base file[#](#step-3-define-the-node-in-the-base-file "Permanent link")

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports[#](#step-31-imports "Permanent link")

Start by adding the import statements:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` import { 	IExecuteFunctions, } from 'n8n-core';  import { 	IDataObject, 	INodeExecutionData, 	INodeType, 	INodeTypeDescription, } from 'n8n-workflow';  import { 	OptionsWithUri, } from 'request';  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class[#](#step-32-create-the-main-class "Permanent link")

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.


| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` export class FriendGrid implements INodeType { 	description: INodeTypeDescription = { 		// Basic node details will go here 		properties: [ 			// Resources and operations will go here 		], 	}; 	// The execute method will go here 	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> { 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Step 3.3: Add node details[#](#step-33-add-node-details "Permanent link")

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` displayName: 'FriendGrid', name: 'friendGrid', icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, description: 'Consume SendGrid API', defaults: { 	name: 'FriendGrid', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ 	{ 		name: 'friendGridApi', 		required: true, 	}, ],  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource[#](#step-34-add-the-resource "Permanent link")

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Resource', 	name: 'resource', 	type: 'options', 	options: [ 		{ 			name: 'Contact', 			value: 'contact', 		}, 	], 	default: 'contact', 	noDataExpression: true, 	required: true, 	description: 'Create a new contact', },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations[#](#step-35-add-operations "Permanent link")

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Operation', 	name: 'operation', 	type: 'options', 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'contact', 			], 		}, 	}, 	options: [ 		{ 			name: 'Create', 			value: 'create', 			description: 'Create a contact', 			action: 'Create a contact', 		}, 	], 	default: 'create', 	noDataExpression: true, }, { 	displayName: 'Email', 	name: 'email', 	type: 'string', 	required: true, 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			operation: [ 				'create', 			], 			resource: [ 				'contact', 			], 		}, 	}, 	default:'', 	placeholder: 'name@email.com', 	description:'Primary email for the contact', },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields[#](#step-36-add-optional-fields "Permanent link")

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Additional Fields', 	name: 'additionalFields', 	type: 'collection', 	placeholder: 'Add Field', 	default: {}, 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'contact', 			], 			operation: [ 				'create', 			], 		}, 	}, 	options: [ 		{ 			displayName: 'First Name', 			name: 'firstName', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 		{ 			displayName: 'Last Name', 			name: 'lastName', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 	], },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Step 4: Add the execute method[#](#step-4-add-the-execute-method "Permanent link")

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 ``` | ``` // Handle data coming from previous nodes const items = this.getInputData(); let responseData; const returnData = []; const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string; const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;  // For each item, make an API call to create a contact for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { 	if (resource === 'contact') { 		if (operation === 'create') { 			// Get email input 			const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; 			// Get additional fields input 			const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject; 			const data: IDataObject = { 				email, 			};  			Object.assign(data, additionalFields);  			// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/ 			const options: OptionsWithUri = { 				headers: { 					'Accept': 'application/json', 				}, 				method: 'PUT', 				body: { 					contacts: [ 						data, 					], 				}, 				uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`, 				json: true, 			}; 			responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options); 			returnData.push(responseData); 		} 	} } // Map data to n8n data structure return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Note the following lines of this code:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` const items = this.getInputData(); ...  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { 	... 	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; 	... }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Users can provide data in two ways:

* Entered directly in the node fields
* By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.

### Step 5: Set up authentication[#](#step-5-set-up-authentication "Permanent link")

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 ``` | ``` import { 	IAuthenticateGeneric, 	ICredentialTestRequest, 	ICredentialType, 	INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType { 	name = 'friendGridApi'; 	displayName = 'FriendGrid API'; 	properties: INodeProperties[] = [ 		{ 			displayName: 'API Key', 			name: 'apiKey', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 	];  	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 		type: 'generic', 		properties: { 			headers: { 				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}', 			}, 		}, 	};  	test: ICredentialTestRequest = { 		request: { 			baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3', 			url: '/marketing/contacts', 		}, 	}; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 6: Add node metadata[#](#step-6-add-node-metadata "Permanent link")

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` { 	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid", 	"nodeVersion": "1.0", 	"codexVersion": "1.0", 	"categories": [ 		"Miscellaneous" 	], 	"resources": { 		"credentialDocumentation": [ 			{ 				"url": "" 			} 		], 		"primaryDocumentation": [ 			{ 				"url": "" 			} 		] 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 7: Update the npm package details[#](#step-7-update-the-npm-package-details "Permanent link")

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 ``` | ``` { 	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-" 	"name": "n8n-nodes-friendgrid", 	"version": "0.1.0", 	"description": "n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid", 	"keywords": [ 		// This keyword is required for community nodes 		"n8n-community-node-package" 	], 	"license": "MIT", 	"homepage": "https://n8n.io", 	"author": { 		"name": "Test", 		"email": "test@example.com" 	}, 	"repository": { 		"type": "git", 		// Change the git remote to your own repository 		// Add the new URL here 		"url": "git+<your-repo-url>" 	}, 	"main": "index.js", 	"scripts": { 		// don't change 	}, 	"files": [ 		"dist" 	], 	// Link the credentials and node 	"n8n": { 		"n8nNodesApiVersion": 1, 		"credentials": [ 			"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js" 		], 		"nodes": [ 			"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js" 		] 	}, 	"devDependencies": { 		// don't change 	}, 	"peerDependencies": { 		// don't change 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node[#](#test-your-node "Permanent link")

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install n8n -g  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In your node directory npm run build npm link  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
   
   
   Check your directory
   
   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
   
   * `~/.n8n/custom/`
   * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.
4. Start n8n:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n start  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
   
   Node names
   
   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

* There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom  cd custom  npm init  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).
* View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost). This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.
* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/).
* Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) and [data structures](/data/data-structure/).

# Tutorial: Build a declarative-style node | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/





[Skip to content](#build-a-declarative-style-node)







# Build a declarative-style node[#](#build-a-declarative-style-node "Permanent link")

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

* JavaScript/TypeScript
* REST APIs
* git

## Build your node[#](#build-your-node "Permanent link")

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project[#](#step-1-set-up-the-project "Permanent link")

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
   
   | ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`  

`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  

`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  

`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm i  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Step 2: Add an icon[#](#step-2-add-an-icon "Permanent link")

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg) as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Create the node[#](#step-3-create-the-node "Permanent link")

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports[#](#step-31-imports "Permanent link")

Start by adding the import statements:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class[#](#step-32-create-the-main-class "Permanent link")

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.


| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export class NasaPics implements INodeType { 	description: INodeTypeDescription = { 		// Basic node details will go here 		properties: [ 		// Resources and operations will go here 		] 	}; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Step 3.3: Add node details[#](#step-33-add-node-details "Permanent link")

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ``` | ``` displayName: 'NASA Pics', name: 'NasaPics', icon: 'file:nasapics.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}', description: 'Get data from NASAs API', defaults: { 	name: 'NASA Pics', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ 	{ 		name: 'NasaPicsApi', 		required: true, 	}, ], requestDefaults: { 	baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov', 	headers: { 		Accept: 'application/json', 		'Content-Type': 'application/json', 	}, },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources[#](#step-34-add-resources "Permanent link")

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` properties: [ 	{ 		displayName: 'Resource', 		name: 'resource', 		type: 'options', 		noDataExpression: true, 		options: [ 			{ 				name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day', 				value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', 			}, 			{ 				name: 'Mars Rover Photos', 				value: 'marsRoverPhotos', 			}, 		], 		default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', 	}, 	// Operations will go here  ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations[#](#step-35-add-operations "Permanent link")

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

| ```   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Operation', 	name: 'operation', 	type: 'options', 	noDataExpression: true, 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', 			], 		}, 	}, 	options: [ 		{ 			name: 'Get', 			value: 'get', 			action: 'Get the APOD', 			description: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day', 			routing: { 				request: { 					method: 'GET', 					url: '/planetary/apod', 				}, 			}, 		}, 	], 	default: 'get', }, { 	displayName: 'Operation', 	name: 'operation', 	type: 'options', 	noDataExpression: true, 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'marsRoverPhotos', 			], 		}, 	}, 	options: [ 		{ 			name: 'Get', 			value: 'get', 			action: 'Get Mars Rover photos', 			description: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover', 			routing: { 				request: { 					method: 'GET', 				}, 			}, 		}, 	], 	default: 'get', }, { 	displayName: 'Rover name', 	description: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from', 	required: true, 	name: 'roverName', 	type: 'options', 	options: [ 		{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'}, 		{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'}, 		{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'}, 		{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'}, 	], 	routing: { 		request: { 			url: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos', 		}, 	}, 	default: 'curiosity', 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'marsRoverPhotos', 			], 		}, 	}, }, { 	displayName: 'Date', 	description: 'Earth date', 	required: true, 	name: 'marsRoverDate', 	type: 'dateTime', 	default:'', 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'marsRoverPhotos', 			], 		}, 	}, 	routing: { 		request: { 			// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string 			qs: { 				earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', 			}, 		}, 	}, }, // Optional/additional fields will go here  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields[#](#step-36-optional-fields "Permanent link")

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Additional Fields', 	name: 'additionalFields', 	type: 'collection', 	default: {}, 	placeholder: 'Add Field', 	displayOptions: { 		show: { 			resource: [ 				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', 			], 			operation: [ 				'get', 			], 		}, 	}, 	options: [ 		{ 			displayName: 'Date', 			name: 'apodDate', 			type: 'dateTime', 			default: '', 			routing: { 				request: { 					// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string 					qs: { 						date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', 					}, 				}, 			}, 		}, 	],									 }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Step 4: Set up authentication[#](#step-4-set-up-authentication "Permanent link")

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ``` | ``` import { 	IAuthenticateGeneric, 	ICredentialType, 	INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType { 	name = 'NasaPicsApi'; 	displayName = 'NASA Pics API'; 	// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example 	// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes 	documentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/'; 	properties: INodeProperties[] = [ 		{ 			displayName: 'API Key', 			name: 'apiKey', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 	]; 	authenticate = { 		type: 'generic', 		properties: { 			qs: { 				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}' 			} 		}, 	} as IAuthenticateGeneric; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 5: Add node metadata[#](#step-5-add-node-metadata "Permanent link")

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` { 	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics", 	"nodeVersion": "1.0", 	"codexVersion": "1.0", 	"categories": [ 		"Miscellaneous" 	], 	"resources": { 		"credentialDocumentation": [ 			{ 				"url": "" 			} 		], 		"primaryDocumentation": [ 			{ 				"url": "" 			} 		] 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details[#](#step-6-update-the-npm-package-details "Permanent link")

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 ``` | ``` { 	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-" 	"name": "n8n-nodes-nasapics", 	"version": "0.1.0", 	"description": "n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.", 	"keywords": [ 		// This keyword is required for community nodes 		"n8n-community-node-package" 	], 	"license": "MIT", 	"homepage": "https://n8n.io", 	"author": { 		"name": "Test", 		"email": "test@example.com" 	}, 	"repository": { 		"type": "git", 		// Change the git remote to your own repository 		// Add the new URL here 		"url": "git+<your-repo-url>" 	}, 	"main": "index.js", 	"scripts": { 		// don't change 	}, 	"files": [ 		"dist" 	], 	// Link the credentials and node 	"n8n": { 		"n8nNodesApiVersion": 1, 		"credentials": [ 			"dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js" 		], 		"nodes": [ 			"dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js" 		] 	}, 	"devDependencies": { 		// don't change 	}, 	"peerDependencies": { 		// don't change 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node[#](#test-your-node "Permanent link")

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install n8n -g  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In your node directory npm run build npm link  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
   
   
   Check your directory
   
   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
   
   * `~/.n8n/custom/`
   * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.
4. Start n8n:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` n8n start  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
   
   Node names
   
   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

* There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom  cd custom  npm init  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).
* View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo). Note that the main node is declarative, while the trigger node is in programmatic style.
* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/).

[Skip to content](#set-up-your-development-environment)







# Set up your development environment[#](#set-up-your-development-environment "Permanent link")

This document lists the essential dependencies for developing a node, as well as guidance on setting up your editor.

## Requirements[#](#requirements "Permanent link")

To build and test a node, you need:

* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).
* A local instance of n8n. You can install n8n with `npm install n8n -g`, then follow the steps in [Run your node locally](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/) to test your node.

You should also have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. This allows you to clone and use the [n8n-node-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).

## Editor setup[#](#editor-setup "Permanent link")

n8n recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor.

Install these extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

By using VS Code and these extensions, you get access to the n8n node linter's warnings as you code.

# Choose node file structure | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/





[Skip to content](#node-file-structure)







# Node file structure[#](#node-file-structure "Permanent link")

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

* Your node's complexity.
* Whether you use node versioning.
* How many nodes you include in the npm package.

## Required files and directories[#](#required-files-and-directories "Permanent link")

Your node must include:

* A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
* A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
  + This directory must contain the [base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
  + n8n recommends including a [codex file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
  + The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
* A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

## Modular structure[#](#modular-structure "Permanent link")

You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin) for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook) as examples.

* `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
  + Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
  + An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)
  + Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
* `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
* `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.

## Versioning[#](#versioning "Permanent link")

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package[#](#decide-how-many-nodes-to-include-in-a-package "Permanent link")

There are two possible setups when building a node:

* One node in one npm package.
* More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes[#](#a-best-practice-example-for-programmatic-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.

# Choose a node building style | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/





[Skip to content](#choose-your-node-building-approach)







# Choose your node building approach[#](#choose-your-node-building-approach "Permanent link")

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

* Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
* Is more future-proof.
* Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

* Trigger nodes
* Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
* Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
* Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences[#](#data-handling-differences "Permanent link")

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences[#](#syntax-differences "Permanent link")

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

# Choose a node type | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-types/





[Skip to content](#node-types-trigger-and-action)







# Node types: Trigger and Action[#](#node-types-trigger-and-action "Permanent link")

There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services.

## Trigger nodes[#](#trigger-nodes "Permanent link")

Trigger nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:

| Type | Description | Example Nodes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook | Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time. | [Zendesk Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Zendesk), [Telegram Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Telegram), [Brevo Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo) |
| Polling | Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates. | [Airtable Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable), [Gmail Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail), [Google Sheet Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet), [RssFeed Read Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RssFeedRead) |
| Others | Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers. | [AMQP Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Amqp), [RabbitMQ Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RabbitMQ), [MQTT Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/MQTT), [Schedule Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Schedule), [Email Trigger (IMAP)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/EmailReadImap) |

## Action nodes[#](#action-nodes "Permanent link")

Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.

To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:

* Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
* Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
* Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute. Refer to the [package.json in the starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/package.json) for an example.
* Check your node using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) and test it locally to ensure it works.
* Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

# Troubleshooting and errors[#](#troubleshooting-and-errors "Permanent link")

## Error: Missing packages[#](#error-missing-packages "Permanent link")

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

* Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](/hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
* Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

# n8n community node blocklist[#](#n8n-community-node-blocklist "Permanent link")

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

* The node is intentionally malicious
* It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact [hello@n8n.io](mailto:%20hello@n8n.io).

# Risks when using community nodes[#](#risks-when-using-community-nodes "Permanent link")

Using community nodes means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

## Report bad community nodes[#](#report-bad-community-nodes "Permanent link")

You can report bad community nodes to [security@n8n.io](mailto:%20security@n8n.io)

## Disable community nodes[#](#disable-community-nodes "Permanent link")

You can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`.

[Skip to content](#node-user-interface-elements)







# Node user interface elements[#](#node-user-interface-elements "Permanent link")

n8n provides a set of predefined UI components (based on a JSON file) that allows users to input all sorts of data types. The following UI elements are available in n8n.

## String[#](#string "Permanent link")

Basic configuration:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: Name, // The value the user sees in the UI 	name: name, // The name used to reference the element UI within the code 	type: string, 	required: true, // Whether the field is required or not 	default: 'n8n', 	description: 'The name of the user', 	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			] 		} 	}, }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![String](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/string.png)

String field for inputting passwords:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Password', 	name: 'password', 	type: 'string', 	required: true, 	typeOptions: { 		password: true, 	}, 	default: '', 	description: `User's password`, 	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			] 		} 	}, }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![Password](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/password.png)

String field with more than one row:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Description', 	name: 'description', 	type: 'string', 	required: true, 	typeOptions: { 		rows: 4, 	}, 	default: '', 	description: 'Description', 	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			] 		} 	}, }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![Multiple rows](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/multiple-rows.png)

### Support drag and drop for data keys[#](#support-drag-and-drop-for-data-keys "Permanent link")

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an expression to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

* `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
* `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts) has examples.

## Number[#](#number "Permanent link")

Number field with decimal points:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Amount', 	name: 'amount', 	type: 'number', 	required: true, 	typeOptions: { 		maxValue: 10, 		minValue: 0, 		numberPrecision: 2, 	}, 	default: 10.00, 	description: 'Your current amount', 	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			] 		} 	}, }  ``` |

| --- | --- |

![Filter](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/filter.png)

## Assignment collection (drag and drop)[#](#assignment-collection-drag-and-drop "Permanent link")

Use the drag and drop component when you want users to pre-fill name and value parameters with a single drag interaction.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Fields to Set', 	name: 'assignments', 	type: 'assignmentCollection', 	default: {}, },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can see an example in n8n's [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/0faeab1228e26d69a2a93bdb2f89523cca1e4036/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Set/v2):

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

## Fixed collection[#](#fixed-collection "Permanent link")

Use the `fixedCollection` type to group fields that are semantically related.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Metadata', 	name: 'metadataUi', 	placeholder: 'Add Metadata', 	type: 'fixedCollection', 	default: '', 	typeOptions: { 		multipleValues: true, 	}, 	description: '', 	options: [ 		{ 			name: 'metadataValues', 			displayName: 'Metadata', 			values: [ 				{ 					displayName: 'Name', 					name: 'name', 					type: 'string', 					default: 'Name of the metadata key to add.', 				}, 				{ 					displayName: 'Value', 					name: 'value', 					type: 'string', 					default: '', 					description: 'Value to set for the metadata key.', 				}, 			], 		}, 	], 	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			] 		} 	}, }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

![Fixed collection](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/fixed-collection.png)

## Resource locator[#](#resource-locator "Permanent link")

![Resource locator](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/resource-locator.png)

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello.

The following options are available:

* ID
* URL
* List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

Example:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Card', 	name: 'cardID', 	type: 'resourceLocator', 	default: '', 	description: 'Get a card', 	modes: [ 		{ 			displayName: 'ID', 			name: 'id', 			type: 'string', 			hint: 'Enter an ID', 			validation: [ 				{ 					type: 'regex', 					properties: { 						regex: '^[0-9]', 						errorMessage: 'The ID must start with a number', 					}, 				}, 			], 			placeholder: '12example', 			// How to use the ID in API call 			url: '=http://api-base-url.com/?id={{$value}}', 		}, 		{ 			displayName: 'URL', 			name: 'url', 			type: 'string', 			hint: 'Enter a URL', 			validation: [ 				{ 					type: 'regex', 					properties: { 						regex: '^http', 						errorMessage: 'Invalid URL', 					}, 				}, 			], 			placeholder: 'https://example.com/card/12example/', 			// How to get the ID from the URL 			extractValue: { 				type: 'regex', 				regex: 'example.com/card/([0-9]*.*)/', 			}, 		}, 		{ 			displayName: 'List', 			name: 'list', 			type: 'list', 			typeOptions: { 				// You must always provide a search method 				// Write this method within the methods object in your base file 				// The method must populate the list, and handle searching if searchable: true 				searchListMethod: 'searchMethod', 				// If you want users to be able to search the list 				searchable: true, 				// Set to true if you want to force users to search 				// When true, users can't browse the list 				// Or false if users can browse a list 				searchFilterRequired: true, 			}, 		}, 	], 	displayOptions: { 		// the resources and operations to display this element with 		show: { 			resource: [ 				// comma-separated list of resource names 			], 			operation: [ 				// comma-separated list of operation names 			], 		}, 	}, },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to the following for live examples:

* Refer to [`CardDescription.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/CardDescription.ts) and [`Trello.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/Trello.node.ts) in n8n's Trello node for an example of a list with search that includes `searchFilterRequired: true`.
* Refer to [`GoogleDrive.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Drive/GoogleDrive.node.ts) for an example where users can browse the list or search.

## Resource mapper[#](#resource-mapper "Permanent link")

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

Mapping and matching

Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update.


| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'Columns', 	name: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code 	type: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type 	default: { 		// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow') 		// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData') 		mappingMode: 'defineBelow', 		// Important: always set default value to null 		value: null, 	}, 	required: true, 	// See "Resource mapper type options interface" below for the full typeOptions specification 	typeOptions: { 		resourceMapper: { 			resourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns', 			mode: 'update', 			fieldWords: { 				singular: 'column', 				plural: 'columns', 			}, 			addAllFields: true,  			multiKeyMatch: true, 			supportAutoMap: true, 			matchingFieldsLabels: { 				title: 'Custom matching columns title', 				description: 'Help text for custom matching columns', 				hint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns', 			}, 		}, 	}, },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2) for a live example using a database schema.

Refer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2) for a live example using a schema-less service.

### Resource mapper type options interface[#](#resource-mapper-type-options-interface "Permanent link")

The `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ``` | ``` export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions { 	// The name of the method where you fetch the schema 	// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail 	resourceMapperMethod: string; 	// Choose the mode for your operation 	// Supported modes: add, update, upsert 	mode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert'; 	// Specify labels for fields in the UI 	fieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string }; 	// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow 	// Default is true 	addAllFields?: boolean; 	// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service  	// (the call is successful but the response is empty) 	noFieldsError?: string; 	// Whether to support multi-key column matching 	// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only 	// Default is false 	// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector 	multiKeyMatch?: boolean; 	// Whether to support automatic mapping 	// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow 	supportAutoMap?: boolean; 	// Custom labels for the matching columns selector 	matchingFieldsLabels?: { 		title?: string; 		description?: string; 		hint?: string; 	}; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Resource mapper method[#](#resource-mapper-method "Permanent link")

This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema.

It must return a value that implements the `ResourceMapperFields` interface:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` interface ResourceMapperField { 	// Field ID as in the service 	id: string; 	// Field label 	displayName: string; 	// Whether n8n should pre-select the field as a matching field 	// A matching field is a column used to identify the rows to modify 	defaultMatch: boolean; 	// Whether the field can be used as a matching field 	canBeUsedToMatch?: boolean; 	// Whether the field is required by the schema 	required: boolean; 	// Whether to display the field in the UI 	// If false, can't be used for matching or mapping 	display: boolean; 	// The data type for the field 	// These correspond to UI element types 	// Supported types: string, number, dateTime, boolean, time, array, object, options 	type?: FieldType; 	// Added at runtime if the field is removed from mapping by the user 	removed?: boolean; 	// Specify options for enumerated types 	options?: INodePropertyOptions[]; }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to the [Postgres resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) and [Google Sheets resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) for live examples.

| --- | --- |

![JSON](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/json.png)

## HTML[#](#html "Permanent link")

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'HTML Template', // The value the user sees in the UI 	name: 'html', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code 	type: 'string', 	typeOptions: { 		editor: 'htmlEditor', 	}, 	default: placeholder, // Loads n8n's placeholder HTML template 	noDataExpression: true, // Prevent using an expression for the field 	description: 'HTML template to render', },  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Refer to [`Html.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Html/Html.node.ts) for a live example.

## Notice[#](#notice "Permanent link")

Display a yellow box with a hint or extra info. Refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/) for guidance on writing good hints and info text.

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` {   displayName: 'Your text here',   name: 'notice',   type: 'notice',   default: '', },  ``` |
| --- | --- |


![Notice](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/notice.png)
## Hints[#](#hints "Permanent link")

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

* Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
* Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than [Notice](#notice). Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view.

### Add a parameter hint[#](#add-a-parameter-hint "Permanent link")

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` { 	displayName: 'URL', 	name: 'url', 	type: 'string', 	hint: 'Enter a URL', 	... }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Add a node hint[#](#add-a-node-hint "Permanent link")

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` description: INodeTypeDescription = { 	... 	hints: [ 		{ 			// The hint message. You can use HTML. 			message: "This node has many input items. Consider enabling <b>Execute Once</b> in the node\'s settings.", 			// Choose from: info, warning, danger. The default is 'info'. 			// Changes the color. info (grey), warning (yellow), danger (red) 			type: 'info', 			// Choose from: inputPane, outputPane, ndv. By default n8n displays the hint in both the input and output panels. 			location: 'outputPane', 			// Choose from: always, beforeExecution, afterExecution. The default is 'always' 			whenToDisplay: 'beforeExecution', 			// Optional. An expression. If it resolves to true, n8n displays the message. Defaults to true. 			displayCondition: '={{ $parameter["operation"] === "select" && $input.all().length > 1 }}' 		} 	] 	... }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node[#](#add-a-dynamic-hint-to-a-programmatic-style-node "Permanent link")

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` if (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {     // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints 	return new NodeExecutionOutput( 		[returnData], 		[ 			{ 				message: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item. To run for the first item only, enable <b>Execute once</b> in the node settings.`, 				location: 'outputPane', 			}, 		], 	); } return [returnData];  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For a live example of a dynamic hint in a programmatic-style node, view the [Split Out node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Transform/SplitOut/SplitOut.node.ts#L266).

# Node UI design | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/





[Skip to content](#design-your-nodes-user-interface)







# Design your node's user interface[#](#design-your-nodes-user-interface "Permanent link")

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

## Design guidance[#](#design-guidance "Permanent link")

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

* Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
  + What can you leave out?
  + What can you simplify?
  + Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
* Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).

## Standards[#](#standards "Permanent link")

### UI text style[#](#ui-text-style "Permanent link")

| Element | Style |
| --- | --- |
| Drop-down value | Title case |
| Hint | Sentence case |
| Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |
| Node name | Title case |
| Parameter name | Title case |
| Subtitle | Title case |
| Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |

### UI text terminology[#](#ui-text-terminology "Permanent link")

* Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).
* Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
* Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
* Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it.

### Node naming conventions[#](#node-naming-conventions "Permanent link")

| Convention | Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If a node is a trigger node, the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |
| Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node |

### Showing and hiding fields[#](#showing-and-hiding-fields "Permanent link")

Fields can either be:

* Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
* Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.

### Conventions by field type[#](#conventions-by-field-type "Permanent link")

#### Credentials[#](#credentials "Permanent link")

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations[#](#resources-and-operations "Permanent link")

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.

#### Required fields[#](#required-fields "Permanent link")

Order fields by:

* Most important to least important.
* Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.

#### Optional fields[#](#optional-fields "Permanent link")

* Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
* If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
* Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
* If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

#### Help[#](#help "Permanent link")

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

* Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
* Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
* Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
* Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.
* Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon !["Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle"](/_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
* You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
* When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
* Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

#### Errors[#](#errors "Permanent link")

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

#### Toggles[#](#toggles "Permanent link")

* Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . .** .
* You may need a list rather than a toggle:
  + Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
  + Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

#### Lists[#](#lists "Permanent link")

* Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
* Sort list options alphabetically.
* You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
* If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like **\***.

#### Trigger node inputs[#](#trigger-node-inputs "Permanent link")

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

* Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
* Don't include a tooltip.

#### Subtitles[#](#subtitles "Permanent link")

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### IDs[#](#ids "Permanent link")

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

* Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
  + By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.
  + By entering an ID.
* Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's [Expressions](/code/expressions/) documentation.
* Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
  + If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
  + If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps[#](#dates-and-timestamps "Permanent link")

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON[#](#json "Permanent link")

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
* Using an expression that returns JSON.

#### Node icons[#](#node-icons "Permanent link")

### Common patterns and exceptions[#](#common-patterns-and-exceptions "Permanent link")

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses[#](#simplify-responses "Permanent link")

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

* Name: **Simplify Response**
* Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations[#](#upsert-operations "Permanent link")

This should always be a separate operation with:

* Name: **Create or Update**
* Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators[#](#boolean-operators "Permanent link")

n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties[#](#source-keys-or-binary-properties "Permanent link")

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.

12. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) for more information on working with this authentication method.

X rate limits

This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.

## X rate limits[#](#x-rate-limits "Permanent link")

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

* If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
* If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types.

# Handling API rate limits | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/





[Skip to content](#handling-api-rate-limits)







# Handling API rate limits[#](#handling-api-rate-limits "Permanent link")

API rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.

APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.

## Identify rate limit issues[#](#identify-rate-limit-issues "Permanent link")

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.

## Handle rate limits for integrations[#](#handle-rate-limits-for-integrations "Permanent link")

There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes:

* Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.
* With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.

### Enable Retry On Fail[#](#enable-retry-on-fail "Permanent link")

When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.

1. Open the node.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.
4. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Use Loop Over Items and Wait[#](#use-loop-over-items-and-wait "Permanent link")

Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.

1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.
2. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.

For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:

!["Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs"](/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)

## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node[#](#handle-rate-limits-in-the-http-request-node "Permanent link")

The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.

### Batch requests[#](#batch-requests "Permanent link")

Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.
2. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.
3. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Paginate results[#](#paginate-results "Permanent link")

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination).

# Custom API actions for existing nodes | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/





[Skip to content](#custom-api-operations)







# Custom API operations[#](#custom-api-operations "Permanent link")

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

* Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
* Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

## Predefined credential types[#](#predefined-credential-types "Permanent link")

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types[#](#using-predefined-credential-types "Permanent link")

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
2. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
3. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
4. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   2. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

### Credential scopes[#](#credential-scopes "Permanent link")

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

[Skip to content](#twist-credentials)







# Twist credentials[#](#twist-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Twist](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twist/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create a [Twist](https://twist.com/) account.
* [Create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app) and configure a valid OAuth Redirect URL. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* OAuth2

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Twist's API documentation](https://developer.twist.com/v3/#authorization) for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a general integration.
* A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a general integration.

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret, [create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app).

Use these settings for your integration's **OAuth Authentication**:

* Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.
  
  OAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n
  
  Twist doesn't accept a `localhost` Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.
* Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.
* Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.

### Local environment redirect URL[#](#local-environment-redirect-url "Permanent link")

Twist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:

1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` ngrok http 5678  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren‚Äôt accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

n8n credentials for both modes

If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.

## Key prefixes[#](#key-prefixes "Permanent link")

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

* Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
* Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

Publishable keys

Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.

For the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:

* Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions) for more information.
* Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role) for more information.

For either option, once you open the role:

1. Go to the **Permissions** section.
2. Open the section for the relevant collection type.
3. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:
   * `create` (POST)
   * `find` and `findone` (GET)
   * `update` (PUT)
   * `delete` (DELETE)
4. Repeat for all relevant collection types.
5. Save the role.

Refer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints) for more information on the permission options.

### Create a user account[#](#create-a-user-account "Permanent link")

Now that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:

1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.
2. Select **Add new entry**.
3. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:
   * **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.
   * **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.
   * **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.
   * **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.

Refer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users) for more information.

## Using API token[#](#using-api-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token) for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.
  
  API tokens permission
  
  If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.
* The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
  
  + For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
* The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
  + **Version 3**
  + **Version 4**

9. Select **Allow**.
10. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
11. If you're using this credential for the [Slack Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/), follow the steps in [Slack Trigger configuration](#slack-trigger-configuration) to finish setting up your app.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information.

### Slack Trigger configuration[#](#slack-trigger-configuration "Permanent link")

To use your Slack app with the [Slack Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node:

1. Go to **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**.
2. Turn on the **Enable Events** control.
3. In n8n, copy the **Webhook URL** and enter it as the **Request URL** in your Slack app.
   
   Request URL
   
   Slack only allows one request URL per app. If you want to test your workflow, you'll need to do one of the following:
   
   * Test with your **Test URL** first, then change your Slack app to use the **Production URL** once you've verified everything's working
   * Use the **Production URL** with execution logging.
4. Once verified, select the bot events to subscribe to. Use the **Trigger on** field in n8n to filter these requests.
   
   * To use an event not in the list, add it as a bot event and select **Any Event** in the n8n node.

Refer to [Quickstart | Configuring the app for event listening](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#listening) for more information.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/) and need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

To get both, create a Slack app:

1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
2. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
3. Enter an **App Name**.
4. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
5. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
6. In **Settings > Basic Information**, open the **App Credentials** section.
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste these into the corresponding fields in n8n.
8. In the left menu under **Features**, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
9. In the **Redirect URLs** section, select **Add New Redirect URL**.
10. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the new Redirect URL in Slack.
11. Select **Add**.
12. Select **Save URLs**.
13. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of scopes.
14. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
15. Select **Allow**.
16. At this point, you should be able to select the OAuth button in your n8n credential to connect.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information. Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

## Scopes[#](#scopes "Permanent link")

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

* If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
* If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

| **Scope name** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:read` |  |
| `channels:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `chat:write` |  |
| `files:read` |  |
| `files:write` |  |
| `groups:read` |  |
| `im:read` |  |
| `mpim:read` |  |
| `reactions:read` |  |
| `reactions:write` |  |
| `stars:read` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `stars:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `usergroups:read` |  |
| `usergroups:write` |  |
| `users.profile:read` |  |
| `users.profile:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `users:read` |  |

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

### Token expired[#](#token-expired "Permanent link")

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

2. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).
3. Select **Develop apps**.
4. Select **Create a custom app**.
   
   Don't see this option?
   
   If you don't see this option, your store probably doesn't have custom app development enabled. Refer to [Enable custom app development](#enable-custom-app-development) for more information.
5. In the modal window, enter the **App name**.
6. Select an **App developer**. The app developer can be the store owner or any account with the **Develop apps** permission.

   * To use all functionality in the [Shopify](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/) node, add the `read_orders`, `write_orders`, `read_products`, and `write_products` scopes.
   * Refer to [Shopify API Access Scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) for more information on the available scopes.
9. Select **Save**.
10. Select **Install app**.
11. In the modal window, select **Install app**.
12. Open the app's **API Credentials** section.
13. Copy the **Admin API Access Token**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.
14. Copy the **API Secret Key**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **APP Secret Key**.

Refer to [Creating a custom app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) and [Generate access tokens for custom apps in the Shopify admin](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-token-types/generate-app-access-tokens-admin) for more information on these steps.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Shopify partner](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account and:

* A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a custom app.
* A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a custom app.
* Your **Shop Subdomain**

To set up the credential, you'll need to create and install a custom app:

Custom app development

Shopify provides templates for creating new apps. The instructions below only cover the elements necessary to set up your n8n credential. Refer to Shopify's [Build dev docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build) for more information on building apps and working with app templates.

1. Open your [Shopify Partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/).
2. Select **Apps** from the left navigation.
3. Select **Create app**.
4. In the **Use Shopify Partners** section, enter an **App name**.
5. Select **Create app**.
6. When the app details open, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
7. Copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
8. In the left menu, select **Configuration**.
9. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the **Allowed redirection URL(s)** in the **URLs** section.
10. In the **URLs** section, enter an **App URL** for your app. The host entered here needs to match the host for the **Allowed redirection URL(s)**, like the base URL for your n8n instance.
11. Select **Save and release**.
12. Select **Overview** from the left menu. At this point, you can choose to **Test your app** by installing it to one of your stores, or **Choose distribution** to distribute it publicly.
13. In n8n, enter the **Shop Subdomain** of the store you installed the app to, either as a test or as a distribution.
    * Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.

## Using API key[#](#using-api-key "Permanent link")

Method deprecated

Shopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **API Key**
* A **Password**
* Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.
* *Optional:* A **Shared Secret**

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Enable custom app development[#](#enable-custom-app-development "Permanent link")

If you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.

To enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:

1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).
2. Select **Develop apps**.
3. Select **Allow custom app development**.
4. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error[#](#forbidden-credentials-error "Permanent link")

If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

# Send Email credentials | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/





[Skip to content](#send-email-credentials)







# Send Email credentials[#](#send-email-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
* Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* SMTP account

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account[#](#using-smtp-account "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **User** email address
* A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
* The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
* A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.
* **SSL/TLS**: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.
* **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
* **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

### Provider instructions[#](#provider-instructions "Permanent link")

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

#### Gmail[#](#gmail "Permanent link")

Refer to [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/gmail).

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Salesforce](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/)
* [Salesforce trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforcetrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* JWT
* OAuth2

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Salesforce's developer documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm) for more information about the service.

## Using JWT[#](#using-jwt "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account and:

* Your **Environment Type** (Production or Sandbox)
* A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a connected app.
* Your Salesforce **Username**
* A **Private Key** for a self-signed digital certificate

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:

1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
2. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
3. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
4. You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm) for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
5. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
6. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
7. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) documentation for more information.
8. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
9. For the **Callback URL**, enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
10. Check the box to **Use digital signatures**.
11. Select **Choose File** and upload the file that contains your digital certificate, such as `server.crt`.
12. Add these **OAuth scopes**:
    * **Full access (full)**
    * **Perform requests at any time (refresh\_token, offline\_access)**
13. Select **Save**, then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
14. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
15. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
16. Enter the contents of the private key file in n8n as **Private Key**.
    * Use the multi-line editor in n8n.
    * Enter the private key in standard PEM key format:
      
      | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- KEY DATA GOES HERE -----END PRIVATE KEY-----  ``` |
      | --- | --- |

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies, session policies, and OAuth policies too:

14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
15. Select **Manage**.
16. Select **Edit Policies**.
17. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.

10. Make sure the following settings are unchecked:
    * **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Extension for Supported Authorization Flows**
    * **Require Secret for Web Server Flow**
    * **Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow**
11. Select **Save**, then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
12. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
13. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
14. Copy the **Consumer Secret** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies and session policies, too:

14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
15. Select **Manage**.
16. Select **Edit Policies**.
17. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.
18. In the **Session Policies** section, Salesforce recommends setting **Timeout Value** to 15 minutes.

* [S3](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Create an account on an S3-compatible server. Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:

* [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)
* [MinIO](https://min.io/)
* [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* S3 endpoint

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/).

## Using S3 endpoint[#](#using-s3-endpoint "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
* A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the "region slug."
* An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
* A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.
* **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
* **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information.

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces[#](#using-digitalocean-spaces "Permanent link")

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
   * Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
   * If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).
4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
5. Select **Generate New Key**.
6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
   * Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    * To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    * To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information.

### Using Wasabi[#](#using-wasabi "Permanent link")

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
   * Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions) to identify the correct URL.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.
3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.

## guest user issues[#](#guest-user-issues "Permanent link")

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

* Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
* Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations[#](#internal-vs-public-integrations "Permanent link")

**Internal** integrations are:

* Specific to a single workspace.
* Accessible only to members of that workspace.
* Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

* Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
* Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
* Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations).

# MySQL credentials | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/





[Skip to content](#mysql-credentials)







# MySQL credentials[#](#mysql-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [MySQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)
* [Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent)

Agent node users

The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server database.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Database connection

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection[#](#using-database-connection "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.
* The **Database** name.
* A **User** name.
* A **Password** for that user.
* The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
* **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
* **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
* **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SHOW DATABASES;  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.
4. Enter the **Password** for that user.
5. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
7. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:
   
   1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
   2. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
   3. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.
8. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:
   1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
      * Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
      * Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.
   2. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   5. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.
   6. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:
      1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.
      2. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

Refer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html) for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL. Refer to [MySQL | Using an SSH Tunnel](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connection-ssh.html) for more information on working with SSH tunnels in MySQL.

* Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
* The **Host**
* The **Port**
* A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
* If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys

To set things up:

1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
   * **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
   * **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
   * **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
2. Enter your broker **Host**.
3. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
4. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
5. Enter that user's **Password**.
6. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
7. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
   * Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
8. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
   1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
      1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
      2. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
      3. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
   2. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server) database.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* SQL database connection

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server) for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection[#](#using-sql-database-connection "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The **Server** name
* The **Database** name
* Your **User** account/ID
* Your **Password**
* The **Port** to use for the connection
* The **Domain** name
* Whether to use **TLS**
* Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
* The **Connect Timeout**
* The **Request Timeout**
* The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:
   * In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
   * In the footer of a query window.
   * Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
   * Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server) for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server).
2. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.
   * If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.
3. Enter your **User** account name or ID.
4. Enter your **Password**.
5. For the **Port**:
   * SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
   * If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server) for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.
6. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
7. Select whether to use **TLS**.
8. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
9. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout) for more information.
   * SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.
10. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation) for more information.
11. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a) for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:
    * **7\_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)**: TDS version 7.4.
    * **7\_3\_B (SQL Server 2008R2)**: TDS version 7.3.B.
    * **7\_3\_A (SQL Server 2008)**: TDS version 7.3.A.
    * **7\_2 (SQL Server 2005)**: TDS version 7.2.
    * **7\_1 (SQL Server 2000)**: TDS version 7.1.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft Entra credentials.

### Need admin approval[#](#need-admin-approval "Permanent link")

When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.

This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.

The procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application[#](#register-an-application "Permanent link")

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
   1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
   2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
   3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret[#](#generate-a-client-secret "Permanent link")

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
2. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
3. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
4. Select **Add**.
5. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
6. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
7. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) below for guidance on completing those fields.
8. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
9. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings[#](#service-specific-settings "Permanent link")

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

#### Dynamics[#](#dynamics "Permanent link")

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
2. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions) for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)[#](#microsoft-general "Permanent link")

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc) for a list of possible scopes.

#### Outlook[#](#outlook "Permanent link")

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
2. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

#### SharePoint[#](#sharepoint "Permanent link")

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.

### Need admin approval[#](#need-admin-approval "Permanent link")

When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.

# HTTP Request credentials | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/





[Skip to content](#http-request-credentials)







# HTTP Request credentials[#](#http-request-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
* [HTTP Request Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.

If you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to [Provide an SSL certificate](#provide-an-ssl-certificate) for the information you'll need.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Predefined credential type
* Basic auth (generic credential type)
* Custom auth (generic credential type)
* Digest auth (generic credential type)
* Header auth (generic credential type)
* OAuth1 (generic credential type)
* OAuth2 (generic credential type)
* Query auth (generic credential type)

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) for more information relating to generic credential types.

Predefined credential types

n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](/integrations/custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using predefined credential type[#](#using-predefined-credential-type "Permanent link")

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
2. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
3. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
4. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   2. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

* The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
* The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using digest auth[#](#using-digest-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

* The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
* The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using header auth[#](#using-header-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

* The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
* The **Value** for the header

Read more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication).

Credential data can vary

The credential data required for header auth credentials depends on the type used. For example, if you need to provide an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, the credential data `Name` will be `Authorization` and the `Value` will be `Bearer <token>`.

## Using OAuth1[#](#using-oauth1 "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

* An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
* An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
* A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
* A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
* A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
* Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
  + **HMAC-SHA1**
  + **HMAC-SHA256**
  + **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

### Authorization Code grant type[#](#authorization-code-grant-type "Permanent link")

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

* An **Authorization URL**
* An **Access Token URL**
* A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
* A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
* *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
* *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
* An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  + **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  + **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
* *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type[#](#client-credentials-grant-type "Permanent link")

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

* An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
* A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
* A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
* *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
* An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  + **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  + **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
* *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### PKCE grant type[#](#pkce-grant-type "Permanent link")

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

* An **Authorization URL**
* An **Access Token URL**
* A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
* A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
* *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
* *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
* An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  + **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  + **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
* *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

## Using query auth[#](#using-query-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)

To configure this credential, enter:

* A query parameter key or **Name**
* A query parameter **Value**

## Using custom auth[#](#using-custom-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers[#](#sending-two-headers "Permanent link")

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	"headers": { 		"X-AUTH-USERNAME": "username", 		"X-AUTH-PASSWORD": "password" 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Body[#](#body "Permanent link")

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	 "body" : { 		"user": "username", 		"pass": "password" 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Query string[#](#query-string "Permanent link")

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	"qs": {  		"appid": "123456", 		"apikey": "my-api-key" 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Sending header and query string[#](#sending-header-and-query-string "Permanent link")

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` { 	"headers": { 		"api-version": "202404" 	}, 	"qs": { 		"apikey": "my-api-key" 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Provide an SSL certificate[#](#provide-an-ssl-certificate "Permanent link")

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.
2. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

* The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
* The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
* The **Private Key** (KEY)
* *Optional:* If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

* Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
* Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field

n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.

To generate your personal access token:

1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) for more information.
2. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
3. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
4. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.
5. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.
7. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.
8. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.
   * A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
   * Refer to
9. Select **Generate token**.
10. Copy the token.

Refer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) for more information on GitHub scopes.

### Set up the credential[#](#set-up-the-credential "Permanent link")

Then, in your n8n credential:

1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.
   * If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.
2. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
3. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps):

1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
2. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
3. In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.
4. Select **New OAuth App**.
   * If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.
5. Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.
6. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.
7. If you'd like, add the optional **Application description**, which GitHub displays to end-users.
8. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.
9. Select **Register application**.
10. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) for more information on the authorization process.

1. Open the downloaded JSON file.
2. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.
3. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `"` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.
   
   Older versions of n8n
   
   If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.
4. **Optional**: Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) (turned on).
   
   1. To use this option, you must [Enable domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation) for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
   2. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.
5. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.
   1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for more information.
6. **Save** your credentials.

## Video[#](#video "Permanent link")

The following video demonstrates the steps described above.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files[#](#service-account-cant-access-google-drive-files "Permanent link")

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and copy your Service Account email.
2. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and go to the designated file or folder.
3. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
4. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
5. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation[#](#enable-domain-wide-delegation "Permanent link")

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

Not recommended

Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation), as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
3. Select **Add new**.
4. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
   * Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth[#](#set-up-oauth "Permanent link")

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
2. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
3. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
4. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
5. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project[#](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project "Permanent link")

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.
2. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.
3. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs[#](#enable-apis "Permanent link")

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.
   ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
   
   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
2. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
3. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.
4. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:
   
   * Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   * Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).
   
   Google Drive API required
   
   The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:
   
   * Google Docs
   * Google Sheets
   * Google Slides
   
   Google Vertex AI API
   
   In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).
5. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen[#](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen "Permanent link")

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.
   ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
   
   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
2. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
3. For **User Type**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Cexternal%2Cinternal) for more information on user types.
4. Select **Create**.
5. Enter the essential information:
   * **App name**
   * **User support email**
   * **Email addresses** field in **Developer contact information**
6. In the **Authorized domains** section, add `n8n.cloud` if using n8n's Cloud service. If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.
7. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** to go to the **Scopes** page.
8. You don't need to set any scopes. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** again to go to the **Summary** page.
9. On the **Summary** page, review the information for accuracy.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials[#](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials "Permanent link")

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select **Credentials**.
2. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
4. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
5. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
6. Select **CREATE**.

### Finish your n8n credential[#](#finish-your-n8n-credential "Permanent link")

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
2. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
3. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
4. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
5. **Save** your new credentials.

## Video[#](#video "Permanent link")

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:

## Scopes[#](#scopes "Permanent link")

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

Supported scopes

| Service | Available scopes |
| --- | --- |
| Gmail | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.action  https://mail.google.com/  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose |

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

### Google hasn't verified this app[#](#google-hasnt-verified-this-app "Permanent link")

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized[#](#google-cloud-app-becoming-unauthorized "Permanent link")

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

# Facebook App credentials | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp/





[Skip to content](#facebook-app-credentials)







# Facebook App credentials[#](#facebook-app-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Facebook Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/)

Facebook Graph API credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Graph API](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/) node, follow the instructions in the [Facebook Graph API credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookgraph/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* App access token

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token[#](#using-app-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

* An app **Access Token**
* An optional **App Secret**: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.
2. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.
3. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).
4. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).
5. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app[#](#create-a-meta-app "Permanent link")

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don‚Äôt want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**.

7. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
8. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
9. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
10. Select **Save changes**.
11. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
12. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
13. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
14. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token[#](#generate-an-app-access-token "Permanent link")

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).
2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
3. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.
4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.
   
   App unavailable
   
   You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.
6. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.
7. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger[#](#configure-the-facebook-trigger "Permanent link")

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
2. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
3. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
4. Select **Test step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
5. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
6. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
   1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
   2. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
   3. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
   4. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
   5. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret[#](#optional-add-an-app-secret "Permanent link")

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
2. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
3. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
4. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
5. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information.

### App review[#](#app-review "Permanent link")

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

* Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
* Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

Refer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access) documentation for more information.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

### Unverified apps limit[#](#unverified-apps-limit "Permanent link")

Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.

Refer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations) if you're over that limit.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/dropbox/





[Skip to content](#dropbox-credentials)







# Dropbox credentials[#](#dropbox-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/)

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
* OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.

App reuse

You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Dropbox's Developer documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation) for more information about the service.

## Using access token[#](#using-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) developer account and:

* An **Access Token**: Generated once you create a Dropbox app.
* An **App Access Type**

To set up the credential, create a Dropbox app:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
2. Select **Create app**.
3. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
4. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
   * **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
   * **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
   * Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
5. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
8. In the **OAuth 2** section, in **Generated access token**, select **Generate**.
9. Copy the access token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
10. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the [Dropbox App Console Settings documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) for more information.

User limits

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app, even with the access token method. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Cloud users need to select the **App Access Type**:

* **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
* **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
* Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 manually:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
2. Select **Create app**.
3. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
4. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
   * **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
   * **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
   * Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
5. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
8. Copy the **App key** and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.
9. Copy the **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.
10. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it in the Dropbox **Redirect URIs**.
11. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the instructions in the [Dropbox Implementing OAuth documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#implementing-oauth) for more information.

For internal tools and limited usage, you can keep your app private. But if you'd like your app to be used by more than 50 users or you want to distribute it, you'll need to complete Dropbox's production approval process. Refer to **Production Approval** in the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

User limits

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

# Discord credentials | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/discord/





[Skip to content](#discord-credentials)







# Discord credentials[#](#discord-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create a [Discord](https://www.discord.com/) account.
* For Bot and OAuth2 credentials:
  + [Set up your local developer environment](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-0-project-setup).
  + [Create an application and a bot user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app).
* For webhook credentials, [create a webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Bot
* OAuth2
* Webhook

Not sure which method to use? Refer to [Choose an authentication method](#choose-an-authentication-method) for more guidance.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Discord's Developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for more information about the service.

## Using bot[#](#using-bot "Permanent link")

Use this method if you want to add the bot to your Discord server using a bot token rather than OAuth2.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Bot Token**: Generated once you create an application with a bot.

To create an application with a bot and generate the **Bot Token**:

1. If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true).
2. Enter a **Name** for your app.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.
5. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token.
6. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.
7. In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for more information on privileged intents.
   * n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD\_MEMBERS**.
8. In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:
   * Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)
   * Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)
   * Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts) documentation for more information about these installation contexts.
9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.
10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) documentation for more information about these and other scopes.
11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:
    * Manage Roles
    * Manage Channels
    * Read Messages/View Channels
    * Send Messages
    * Create Public Threads
    * Create Private Threads
    * Send Messages in Threads
    * Send TTS Messages
    * Manage Messages
    * Manage Threads
    * Embed Links
    * Attach Files
    * Read Message History
    * Add Reactions
12. Add the app to your server or test server:
    1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.
    2. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.
    3. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.
    4. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.

These steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) guide for more information on creating an app, especially:

* [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials) for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.
* [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity) for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**
* Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**
* A **Bot Token**

For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.

Then:

1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.
2. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.
3. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.

## Using webhook[#](#using-webhook "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.

To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:

1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.
2. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
3. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.
4. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.
5. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.
6. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for more information.

## Choose an authentication method[#](#choose-an-authentication-method "Permanent link")

The simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.

A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.

**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server.

## Using API key[#](#using-api-key "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Tracking API Key**: For use with the [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`. See the FAQs below for more details.
* Your **Region**: Customer.io uses different API subdomains depending on the region you select. Options include:
  + **Global region**: Keeps the default URLs for both APIs; for use in all non-EU countries/regions.
  + **EU region**: Adjusts the Track API subdomain to `track-eu` and the App API subdomain to `api-eu`; only use this if you are in the EU.
* A **Tracking Site ID**: Required with your **Tracking API Key**
* An **App API Key**: For use with the [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/) at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`. See the FAQs below for more details.

Refer to the [Customer.io Finding and managing your API credentials documentation](https://customer.io/docs/accounts-and-workspaces/managing-credentials/) for instructions on creating both Tracking API and App API keys.

## Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key[#](#why-you-need-a-tracking-api-key-and-an-app-api-key "Permanent link")

Customer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:

* The [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`
* The [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/) at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`

The Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.

Based on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint.

# Custom n8n Workflow Tool node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/





[Skip to content](#custom-n8n-workflow-tool-node)







# Custom n8n Workflow Tool node[#](#custom-n8n-workflow-tool-node "Permanent link")

The Workflow Tool node is a tool that allows an agent to run another n8n workflow and fetch its output data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Name[#](#name "Permanent link")

Enter a name for your custom code. It can't contain whitespace or special characters.

### Description[#](#description "Permanent link")

Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Source[#](#source "Permanent link")

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

* **Database** and enter a workflow ID.
* **Parameter** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](/workflows/export-import/).

### Workflow Values[#](#workflow-values "Permanent link")

Set values to pass to the workflow you're calling.

These values appear in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you call. You can access these values in expressions in the workflow. For example, if you have:

* **Workflow Values** with a **Name** of `myCustomValue`
* A workflow with an Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node as its trigger

The expression to access the value of `myCustomValue` is `{{ $('Execute Sub-workflow Trigger').item.json.myCustomValue }}`.

### Specify input schema[#](#specify-input-schema "Permanent link")

Agent support

The structured input schema requires with a Tools Agent or OpenAI Functions Agent.

Enable this option to define the input schema for the workflow you're calling. This is useful when you want to make sure the input data the LLM provides is in the correct format.

**Schema Type**: Define the input structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:

1. **Generate from JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.
2. **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema.

## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples "Permanent link")

# Wikipedia node[#](#wikipedia-node "Permanent link")

The Wikipedia node is a tool that allows an agent to search and return information from Wikipedia.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Use the Vector Store Retriever node to retrieve documents from a vector store.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Vector Store Retriever node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

# Structured Output Parser node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#structured-output-parser-node-common-issues)







# Structured Output Parser node common issues[#](#structured-output-parser-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters[#](#processing-parameters "Permanent link")

The Structured Output Parser node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes[#](#adding-the-structured-output-parser-node-to-ai-nodes "Permanent link")

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps[#](#using-the-structured-output-parser-to-format-intermediary-steps "Permanent link")

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results.

## Structuring output from agents[#](#structuring-output-from-agents "Permanent link")

Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with [agents](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate [LLM-chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) to receive the data from the agent and parse it. This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow.

# Structured Output Parser node[#](#structured-output-parser-node "Permanent link")

Use the Structured Output Parser node to return fields based on a JSON Schema.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Structured Output Parser node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Schema Type**: Define the output structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:

1. **Generate from JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.
2. **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema.

# Redis Chat Memory node[#](#redis-chat-memory-node "Permanent link")

Use the Redis Chat Memory node to use Redis as a memory server.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Redis Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/redis/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
* **Session Time To Live**: Use this parameter to make the session expire after a given number of seconds.
* **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

# Window Buffer Memory node common issues[#](#window-buffer-memory-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Window Buffer Memory node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance[#](#single-memory-instance "Permanent link")

If you add more than one Window Buffer Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID[#](#managing-the-session-id "Permanent link")

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.

# Ollama Model node common issues | n8n Docs

[Skip to content](#ollama-model-node-common-issues)







# Ollama Model node common issues[#](#ollama-model-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmollama/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters[#](#processing-parameters "Permanent link")

The Ollama Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance[#](#cant-connect-to-a-remote-ollama-instance "Permanent link")

The Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-ollama-instance-when-using-docker "Permanent link")

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker[#](#if-only-ollama-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers "Permanent link")

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container "Permanent link")

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434[#](#error-connect-econnrefused-111434 "Permanent link")

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

# OpenRouter Chat Model node[#](#openrouter-chat-model-node "Permanent link")

Use the OpenRouter Chat Model node to use OpenRouter's chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenRouter Chat Model node and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openrouter/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

# OpenAI Chat Model node common issues[#](#openai-chat-model-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI Chat Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters[#](#processing-parameters "Permanent link")

The OpenAI Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#the-service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you "Permanent link")

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

   | --- | --- |
2. Use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota[#](#insufficient-quota "Permanent link")

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

Zero balance issue

If you create an API key when the account balance is zero, operations will always report "insufficient quota" even if funds are added later. To avoid this issue, ensure that there is credit in the account before issuing a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

* Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
* Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
* Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
* Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
* Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
* Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

* check that the [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
* ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters[#](#bad-request-please-check-your-parameters "Permanent link")

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

# Ollama Chat Model node common issues | n8n Docs

[Skip to content](#ollama-chat-model-node-common-issues)







# Ollama Chat Model node common issues[#](#ollama-chat-model-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters[#](#processing-parameters "Permanent link")

The Ollama Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance[#](#cant-connect-to-a-remote-ollama-instance "Permanent link")

The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-ollama-instance-when-using-docker "Permanent link")

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker[#](#if-only-ollama-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers "Permanent link")

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container "Permanent link")

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434[#](#error-connect-econnrefused-111434 "Permanent link")

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

# Mistral Cloud Chat Model node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatmistralcloud/





[Skip to content](#mistral-cloud-chat-model-node)







# Mistral Cloud Chat Model node[#](#mistral-cloud-chat-model-node "Permanent link")

Use the Mistral Cloud Chat Model node to combine Mistral Cloud's chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Mistral Cloud Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mistral/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads models from Mistral Cloud and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
* **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
* **Timeout**: Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.
* **Max Retries**: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.
* **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
* **Enable Safe Mode**: Enable safe mode by injecting a safety prompt at the beginning of the completion. This helps prevent the model from generating offensive content.
* **Random Seed**: Enter a seed to use for random sampling. If set, different calls will generate deterministic results.

[Skip to content](#embeddings-openai-node)







# Embeddings OpenAI node[#](#embeddings-openai-node "Permanent link")

Use the Embeddings OpenAI node to generate embeddings for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings OpenAI node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Model**: Select the model to use for generating embeddings.
* **Base URL**: Enter the URL to send the request to. Use this if you are using a self-hosted OpenAI-like model.
* **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.
* **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.
* **Timeout**: Enter the maximum amount of time a request can take in seconds. Set to `-1` for no timeout.

# GitHub Document Loader node[#](#github-document-loader-node "Permanent link")

Use the GitHub Document Loader node to load data from a GitHub repository for vector stores or summarization.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the GitHub Document Loader node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/github/). This node doesn't support OAuth for authentication.


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

# Zep Vector Store node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorezep/





[Skip to content](#zep-vector-store-node)







# Zep Vector Store node[#](#zep-vector-store-node "Permanent link")

Use the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect it directly to an agent to use as a tool.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/zep/).


Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Zep Vector Store integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/zep-vector-store/) page.


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns[#](#node-usage-patterns "Permanent link")

You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents[#](#use-as-a-regular-node-to-insert-update-and-retrieve-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool[#](#connect-directly-to-an-ai-agent-as-a-tool "Permanent link")

You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents[#](#use-a-retriever-to-fetch-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions[#](#use-the-vector-store-question-answer-tool-to-answer-questions "Permanent link")

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Operation Mode[#](#operation-mode "Permanent link")

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many[#](#get-many "Permanent link")

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents[#](#insert-documents "Permanent link")

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Insert Documents parameters[#](#insert-documents-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to store the data in.

### Get Many parameters[#](#get-many-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
* **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
* **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Name**: The name of the vector store.
* **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
* **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
* **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

### Embedding Dimensions[#](#embedding-dimensions "Permanent link")

Must be the same when embedding the data and when querying it.

This sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document.

Read more about Zep embeddings in [Zep's embeddings documentation](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/embeddings/).

### Is Auto Embedded[#](#is-auto-embedded "Permanent link")

Available in the **Insert Documents** Operation Mode, enabled by default.

Disable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n.

### Metadata Filter[#](#metadata-filter "Permanent link")

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Qdrant Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Qdrant Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2183-ai-crew-to-automate-fundamental-stock-analysis-qanda-workflow/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions[#](#use-the-vector-store-question-answer-tool-to-answer-questions "Permanent link")

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Qdrant Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Qdrant Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector store.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Operation Mode[#](#operation-mode "Permanent link")

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many[#](#get-many "Permanent link")

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents[#](#insert-documents "Permanent link")

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Get Many parameters[#](#get-many-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Qdrant collection name**: Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.
* **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
* **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

# PGVector Vector Store node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepgvector/





[Skip to content](#pgvector-vector-store-node)







# PGVector Vector Store node[#](#pgvector-vector-store-node "Permanent link")

PGVector is an extension of Postgresql. Use this node to interact with the PGVector tables in your Postgresql database. You can insert documents into a vector table, get documents from a vector table, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect directly to an agent as a tool.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the PGVector node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/postgres/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns[#](#node-usage-patterns "Permanent link")

You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents[#](#use-as-a-regular-node-to-insert-and-retrieve-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreinmemory/





[Skip to content](#in-memory-vector-store-node)







# In-Memory Vector Store node[#](#in-memory-vector-store-node "Permanent link")

Use the In Memory Vector Store node to store and retrieve embeddings in n8n's in-app memory.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the In Memory Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.


This node is different to AI memory nodes

The in-memory storage described here is different to the AI memory nodes such as [Window Buffer Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/).

This node creates a vector database in the app memory.

## Node usage patterns[#](#node-usage-patterns "Permanent link")

You can use the In-Memory Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents[#](#use-as-a-regular-node-to-insert-and-retrieve-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the In-Memory Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the In-Memory Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of in step 2 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool[#](#connect-directly-to-an-ai-agent-as-a-tool "Permanent link")

You can connect the In-Memory Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> In-Memory Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents[#](#use-a-retriever-to-fetch-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the In-Memory Vector Store node to fetch documents from the In-Memory Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions[#](#use-the-vector-store-question-answer-tool-to-answer-questions "Permanent link")

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the In-Memory Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the In-Memory Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store.

# Sentiment Analysis node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.sentimentanalysis/





[Skip to content](#sentiment-analysis-node)







# Sentiment Analysis node[#](#sentiment-analysis-node "Permanent link")

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be
  `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
  + By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
* **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

## Usage Notes[#](#usage-notes "Permanent link")

### Model Temperature Setting[#](#model-temperature-setting "Permanent link")

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations[#](#language-considerations "Permanent link")

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes[#](#processing-large-volumes "Permanent link")

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement[#](#iterative-refinement "Permanent link")

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

## Example Usage[#](#example-usage "Permanent link")

### Basic Sentiment Analysis[#](#basic-sentiment-analysis "Permanent link")

1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
2. Set the "Text to Analyze" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
3. Keep the default sentiment categories.
4. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis[#](#custom-category-analysis "Permanent link")

1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
2. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
3. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

# Text Classifier node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/





[Skip to content](#text-classifier-node)







# Text Classifier node[#](#text-classifier-node "Permanent link")

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
* **Categories**: Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True**: You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
* **When No Clear Match**: Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
  + **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
  + **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch**: Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

# Information Extractor node[#](#information-extractor-node "Permanent link")

Use the Information Extractor node to extract structured information from incoming data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Information Extractor node,
and links to more resources.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Text** defines the input text to extract information from. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger, or `{{ $json.text }}` if a previous node is Extract from PDF.
* Use **Schema Type** to choose how you want to describe the desired output data format. You can choose between:
  + **From Attribute Description**: This option allows you to define the schema by specifying the list of attributes and their descriptions.
  + **Generate From JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.
  + **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the information extraction. n8n automatically appends format specification instructions to the prompt.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

# Question and Answer Chain node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#question-and-answer-chain-node-common-issues)







# Question and Answer Chain node common issues[#](#question-and-answer-chain-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error[#](#no-prompt-specified-error "Permanent link")

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
   * Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   * To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
   * Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error[#](#a-retriever-sub-node-must-be-connected-error "Permanent link")

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses[#](#cant-produce-longer-responses "Permanent link")

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

* **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
* **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
* **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/).

# Basic LLM Chain node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/





[Skip to content](#basic-llm-chain-node)







# Basic LLM Chain node[#](#basic-llm-chain-node "Permanent link")

Use the Basic LLM Chain node to set the prompt that the model will use along with setting an optional parser for the response.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Basic LLM Chain node and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Basic LLM Chain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/basic-llm-chain/) page.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Prompt[#](#prompt "Permanent link")

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

* **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
* **Define below**: If you select this option, enter the **Text** you want to use as the prompt. You can use expressions here for dynamic content.

### Require Specific Output Format[#](#require-specific-output-format "Permanent link")

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

* [Auto-fixing Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
* [Item List Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
* [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Chat Messages[#](#chat-messages "Permanent link")

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

#### AI[#](#ai "Permanent link")

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

#### System[#](#system "Permanent link")

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

#### User[#](#user "Permanent link")

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

* **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
* **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
* **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

* **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
* **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
* **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

# AI Agent node common issues[#](#ai-agent-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'[#](#internal-error-400-invalid-value-for-content "Permanent link")

A full error message might look like this:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` Internal error Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null. <stack-trace>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   * To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   * To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Window Buffer Memory[#](#error-in-sub-node-window-buffer-memory "Permanent link")

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Window Buffer Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Window Buffer Memory node.

Try removing the Window Buffer Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error[#](#a-chat-model-sub-node-must-be-connected-error "Permanent link")

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error[#](#no-prompt-specified-error "Permanent link")

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/).

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/sql-agent/





[Skip to content](#sql-ai-agent-node)







# SQL AI Agent node[#](#sql-ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

The SQL Agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format. This agent is valuable for building natural language interfaces to databases.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the SQL Agent using the following parameters.

### Data Source[#](#data-source "Permanent link")

Choose the database to use as a data source for the node. Options include:

* **MySQL**: Select this option to use a MySQL database.
  + Also select the **Credential for MySQL**.
* **SQLite**: Select this option to use a SQLite database.
  + You must add a [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node before the Agent to read your SQLite file.
  + Also enter the **Input Binary Field** name of your SQLite file coming from the Read/Write File From Disk node.
* **Postgres**: Select this option to use a Postgres database.
  + Also select the **Credential for Postgres**.

Postgres and MySQL Agents

If you are using [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/credentials/postgres/) or [MySQL](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), this agent doesn't support the credential tunnel options.

### Prompt[#](#prompt "Permanent link")

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

* **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
* **Define below**: If you select this option, enter the **Text** you want to use as the prompt. You can use expressions here for dynamic content.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Refine the SQL Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Ignored Tables[#](#ignored-tables "Permanent link")

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows[#](#include-sample-rows "Permanent link")

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.

### Included Tables[#](#included-tables "Permanent link")

If you'd only like to include specific tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables to include.

If left empty, the agent includes all tables.

### Prefix Prompt[#](#prefix-prompt "Permanent link")

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent before the **Prompt** text. This initial message can provide more context and guidance to the agent about what it can and can't do, and how to format the response.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Suffix Prompt[#](#suffix-prompt "Permanent link")

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent after the **Prompt** text.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{chatHistory}`: A history of messages in this conversation, useful for maintaining context.
* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Limit[#](#limit "Permanent link")

Enter the maximum number of results to return.

Default is `10`.

## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples "Permanent link")

# ReAct AI Agent node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/react-agent/





[Skip to content](#react-ai-agent-node)







# ReAct AI Agent node[#](#react-ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

The ReAct Agent node implements [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) logic. ReAct (reasoning and acting) brings together the reasoning powers of chain-of-thought prompting and action plan generation.

The ReAct Agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

No memory

The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the ReAct Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt[#](#prompt "Permanent link")

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

* **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
* **Define below**: If you select this option, enter the **Text** you want to use as the prompt. You can use expressions here for dynamic content.

### Require Specific Output Format[#](#require-specific-output-format "Permanent link")

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

* [Auto-fixing Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
* [Item List Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
* [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use the options to create a message to send to the agent at the start of the conversation. The message type depends on the model you're using:

* **Chat models**: These models have the concept of three components interacting (AI, system, and human). They can receive system messages and human messages (prompts).
* **Instruct models**: These models don't have the concept of separate AI, system, and human components. They receive one body of text, the instruct message.

### Human Message Template[#](#human-message-template "Permanent link")

Use this option to extend the user prompt. This is a way for the agent to pass information from one iteration to the next.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

### Prefix Message[#](#prefix-message "Permanent link")

Enter text to prefix the tools list at the start of the conversation. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Chat Model[#](#suffix-message-for-chat-model "Permanent link")

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a chat model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Regular Model[#](#suffix-message-for-regular-model "Permanent link")

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a regular/instruct model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Return Intermediate Steps[#](#return-intermediate-steps "Permanent link")

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/openai-functions-agent/





[Skip to content](#openai-functions-agent-node)







# OpenAI Functions Agent node[#](#openai-functions-agent-node "Permanent link")

Use the OpenAI Functions Agent node to use an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). These are models that detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

OpenAI Chat Model required

# Pinecone Vector Store node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/





[Skip to content](#pinecone-vector-store-node)







# Pinecone Vector Store node[#](#pinecone-vector-store-node "Permanent link")

Use the Pinecone node to interact with your Pinecone database as vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect directly to an agent as a tool.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/pinecone/).


Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns[#](#node-usage-patterns "Permanent link")

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents[#](#use-as-a-regular-node-to-insert-update-and-retrieve-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Pinecone Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool[#](#connect-directly-to-an-ai-agent-as-a-tool "Permanent link")

You can connect the Pinecone Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents[#](#use-a-retriever-to-fetch-documents "Permanent link")

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Pinecone Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Pinecone Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions[#](#use-the-vector-store-question-answer-tool-to-answer-questions "Permanent link")

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Pinecone Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Pinecone Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2705-chat-with-github-api-documentation-rag-powered-chatbot-with-pinecone-and-openai/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector store.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Operation Mode[#](#operation-mode "Permanent link")

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many[#](#get-many "Permanent link")

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents[#](#insert-documents "Permanent link")

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent "Permanent link")

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents[#](#update-documents "Permanent link")

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

### Get Many parameters[#](#get-many-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Pinecone Index**: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.
* **Prompt**: Enter your search query.
* **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

# Conversational AI Agent node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/conversational-agent/





[Skip to content](#conversational-ai-agent-node)







# Conversational AI Agent node[#](#conversational-ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes tools in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt[#](#prompt "Permanent link")

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

* **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
* **Define below**: If you select this option, enter the **Text** you want to use as the prompt. You can use expressions here for dynamic content.

### Require Specific Output Format[#](#require-specific-output-format "Permanent link")

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

* [Auto-fixing Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
* [Item List Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
* [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message[#](#human-message "Permanent link")

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

* `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
* `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
* `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

Example:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` TOOLS ------ Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:  {tools}  {format_instructions}  USER'S INPUT -------------------- Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):  {{input}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### System Message[#](#system-message "Permanent link")

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations[#](#max-iterations "Permanent link")

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps[#](#return-intermediate-steps "Permanent link")

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples "Permanent link")

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/#templates-and-examples) section.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/common-issues/).

## AI glossary[#](#ai-glossary "Permanent link")

# AI Agent node[#](#ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

An AI agent is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself, which might include customer queries, tools, or other context.

The AI Agent node gives you six LangChain agent options.

On this page, you'll find a summary of the available agents with links to more detailed pages on each, templates and examples, and links to more resources.

Connect a tool

You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.

## Available agents[#](#available-agents "Permanent link")

n8n provides these agents:

* [**Tools Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) (default): This agent uses external tools and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.
  
  Begin here
  
  n8n recommends using this agent for most use cases. It will handle most scenarios and provides the best experience when working with [tools](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).
* [**Conversational Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/conversational-agent/): This agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants and customer support systems. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good option.
* [**OpenAI Functions Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/openai-functions-agent/): Use this agent with an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling). You must use the [OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/) with this agent.
* [**Plan and Execute Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/plan-execute-agent/): This agent creates a high-level plan to solve the given task and then executes the plan step by step. It's most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.
* [**ReAct Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/react-agent/): This agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.
  
  No memory
  
  The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.
* [**SQL Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/sql-agent/): This agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format. This agent is valuable for building natural language interfaces to databases.

# LangChain Code node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/





[Skip to content](#langchain-code-node)







# LangChain Code node[#](#langchain-code-node "Permanent link")

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

Not available on Cloud

This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Add Code[#](#add-code "Permanent link")

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

### Inputs[#](#inputs "Permanent link")

Choose the input types.

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs[#](#outputs "Permanent link")

Choose the output types.

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration[#](#node-inputs-and-outputs-configuration "Permanent link")

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with four LangChain nodes, configured as different node types](/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchaincode/create-node-types.png)

| Node type | Inputs | Outputs | Code mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App node. Similar to the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/). | Main | Main | Execute |
| Root node | Main; at least one other type | Main | Execute |
| Sub-node | - | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |
| Sub-node with sub-nodes | A type other than main | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |

## Built-in methods[#](#built-in-methods "Permanent link")

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `this.addInputData(inputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n. |
| `this.addOutputData(outputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.  * `outputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n. |
| `this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)` | Get data from a specified non-main input.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `itemIndex` should always be `0` (this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality) * Use `inputIndex` if there is more than one node connected to the specified input. |
| `this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)` | Get data from the main input. |
| `this.getNode()` | Get the current node. |
| `this.getNodeOutputs()` | Get the outputs of the current node. |
| `this.getExecutionCancelSignal()` | Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the [Cancelling a running LLMChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain#cancelling-a-running-llmchain) code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally. |

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production "Permanent link")

WhatsApp only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), WhatsApp overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# Telegram Trigger node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#telegram-trigger-node-common-issues)







# Telegram Trigger node common issues[#](#telegram-trigger-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event[#](#stuck-waiting-for-trigger-event "Permanent link")

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Test step** or or **Test workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook[#](#bad-request-bad-webhook-an-https-url-must-be-provided-for-webhook "Permanent link")

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production "Permanent link")

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

* **Watch Whole Workspace**: Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
  
  Caution
  
  This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!
* **Channel to Watch**: Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**. You can select a channel:
  
  + **From list**: The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want.
  + **By ID**: Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.
  + **By URL**: Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.
* **Download Files**: Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.

## Options[#](#options "Permanent link")

You can further refine the node's behavior when you **Add Option**s:

* **Resolve IDs**: Whether to resolve the IDs to their respective names and return them (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
* **Usernames or IDs to ignore**: Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from. Choose from the list, or specify IDs using an [expression](/code/expressions/).

Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for details about their API.

## Required scopes[#](#required-scopes "Permanent link")

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production "Permanent link")

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

### Token expired[#](#token-expired "Permanent link")

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [KoboToolbox Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/kobotoolbox-trigger/) page.

This node starts a workflow upon new submissions of a specified form. The trigger node handles the creation/deletion of the hook, so you don't need to do any setup in KoboToolbox.

It works the same way as the Get Submission operation in the [KoboToolbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kobotoolbox/) node, including supporting the same reformatting options.

# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues | n8n Docs

[Skip to content](#google-sheets-trigger-node-common-issues)







# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues[#](#google-sheets-trigger-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event[#](#stuck-waiting-for-trigger-event "Permanent link")

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Test step** or or **Test workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers[#](#date-and-time-columns-are-rendering-as-numbers "Permanent link")

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:

1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
2. Select **Add option**.
3. Select **DateTime Render**.
4. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value.

# Google Drive Trigger node common issues | n8n Docs

# Google Drive Trigger node common issues[#](#google-drive-trigger-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrivetrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## 401 unauthorized error[#](#401-unauthorized-error "Permanent link")

The full text of the error looks like this:


| ``` 1 ``` | ``` 401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}  ``` |
| --- | --- |


This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
2. For [Service Account](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   2. Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Handling more than one file change[#](#handling-more-than-one-file-change "Permanent link")

The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).

If multiple changes to the **Watch For** criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.

You can use an [if node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or a [switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production "Permanent link")

Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues | n8n Docs

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues[#](#whatsapp-business-cloud-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters[#](#bad-request-please-check-your-parameters "Permanent link")

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media[#](#working-with-non-text-media "Permanent link")

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to "n8n", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`.

# Telegram node common issues[#](#telegram-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel[#](#add-a-bot-to-a-telegram-channel "Permanent link")

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:
`Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
2. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
3. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
4. Search for the bot's username and select it.
5. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID[#](#get-the-chat-id "Permanent link")

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second[#](#send-more-than-30-messages-per-second "Permanent link")

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
2. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
3. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages[#](#remove-the-n8n-attribution-from-sent-messages "Permanent link")

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.

# Supabase node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.supabase/common-issues/

# Supabase node common issues[#](#supabase-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Supabase node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.supabase/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Filtering rows by metadata[#](#filtering-rows-by-metadata "Permanent link")

To filter rows by [Supabase metadata](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata), set the **Select Type** to **String**.

From there, you can construct a query in the **Filters (String)** parameter to filter the metadata using the [Supabase metadata query language](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata#metadata-query-language), inspired by the [MongoDB selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) format. Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

For example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` metadata->>age=gte.21  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.

## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-supabase-database-when-using-docker "Permanent link")

When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Supabase is in Docker[#](#if-only-supabase-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-supabase-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers "Permanent link")

If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase/), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.

## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase[#](#records-are-accessible-through-postgres-but-not-supabase "Permanent link")

If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.

Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.

To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

[Skip to content](#postgres-node-common-issues)







# Postgres node common issues[#](#postgres-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters[#](#dynamically-populate-sql-in-groups-with-parameters "Permanent link")

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');  ``` |
| --- | --- |

While you can use n8n [expressions](/code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.
2. In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.
3. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.
4. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
5. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones[#](#working-with-timestamps-and-time-zones "Permanent link")

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

* **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
* **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).
* **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).

## Use query parameters[#](#use-query-parameters "Permanent link")

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` [     {         "email": "alex@example.com",         "name": "Alex",         "age": 21      },     {         "email": "jamie@example.com",         "name": "Jamie",         "age": 33      } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can write a query like:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // users is an example table name users, {{ $json.email }}   ``` |

# OpenAI node common issues[#](#openai-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#the-service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you "Permanent link")

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

   | --- | --- |
2. Use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota[#](#insufficient-quota "Permanent link")

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

Zero balance issue

If you create an API key when the account balance is zero, operations will always report "insufficient quota" even if funds are added later. To avoid this issue, ensure that there is credit in the account before issuing a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

* Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
* Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
* Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
* Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
* Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
* Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

* check that the [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
* ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters[#](#bad-request-please-check-your-parameters "Permanent link")

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

## Referenced node is unexecuted[#](#referenced-node-is-unexecuted "Permanent link")

This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input.

The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn‚Äôt been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $("<node-name>").isExecuted  ``` |

# OpenAI Text operations | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/text-operations/





[Skip to content](#openai-text-operations)







# OpenAI Text operations[#](#openai-text-operations "Permanent link")

Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

## Message a Model[#](#message-a-model "Permanent link")

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

* **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).
* **Resource**: Select **Text**.
* **Operation**: Select **Message a Model**.
* **Model**: Select the model you want to use. If you‚Äôre not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.
* **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles:
  + **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
  + **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
  + **System**: By default, the system message is `"You are a helpful assistant"`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
* **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.
* **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

### Options[#](#options "Permanent link")

* **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
* **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
* **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens.
* **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
* **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they‚Äôre too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
* **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.

Refer to [Message a Model | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/text-completion/create) documentation for more information.

## Classify Text for Violations[#](#classify-text-for-violations "Permanent link")

Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:

* `flagged`: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.
* `categories`: A list of category-specific violation flags.
* `category_scores`: Scores for each category.

Enter these parameters:

* **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).
* **Resource**: Select **Text**.
* **Operation**: Select **Classify Text for Violations**.
* **Text Input**: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy.
* **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

### Options[#](#options_1 "Permanent link")

* **Use Stable Model**: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.

Refer to [Moderations | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations) documentation for more information.

# Notion node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#notion-node-common-issues)







# Notion node common issues[#](#notion-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Relation property not displaying[#](#relation-property-not-displaying "Permanent link")

The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.

To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.

If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Enable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` { 	"properties": { 		"Account": { 			"relation": [ 				{ 					"id": "<your_relation_ID>" 				} 			] 		} 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Create toggle heading[#](#create-toggle-heading "Permanent link")

The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page**, **Database Page**, or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.

You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):

1. Add a heading with Notion node.
2. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
   * To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.
   * To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.
3. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.
4. Add an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.
5. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
6. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
7. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node after the HTTP Request node.
8. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.
9. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
10. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.
11. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
12. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.
13. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).
14. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).

The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.

## Handle null and empty values[#](#handle-null-and-empty-values "Permanent link")

You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.

To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.

To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.

As an alternative, you can set a [default value](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

# MySQL node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#mysql-node-common-issues)







# MySQL node common issues[#](#mysql-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key[#](#update-rows-by-composite-key "Permanent link")

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-mysql-server-when-using-docker "Permanent link")

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker[#](#if-only-mysql-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest  ``` |
| --- | --- |

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker "Permanent link")

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-mysql-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers "Permanent link")

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-mysql-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container "Permanent link")

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings[#](#decimal-numbers-returned-as-strings "Permanent link")

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html) for more information about the service.

Refer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html) for more information on writing SQL queries.

## Use query parameters[#](#use-query-parameters "Permanent link")

When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` [     {         "email": "alex@example.com",         "name": "Alex",         "age": 21      },     {         "email": "jamie@example.com",         "name": "Jamie",         "age": 33      } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can write a query like:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // users is an example table name users, {{ $json.email }}   ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails[#](#updating-the-allow-external-senders-and-auto-subscribe-new-members-options-fails "Permanent link")

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.

## Options[#](#options "Permanent link")

### Query Options[#](#query-options "Permanent link")

The Query Submission operation supports query options:

* In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:
  + **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
  + **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
* In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:
  + **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
  + **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
  + **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.

More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)

### Submission options[#](#submission-options "Permanent link")

All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:

* Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).
* Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).

#### About reformatting[#](#about-reformatting "Permanent link")

The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting:

* Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
* Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
* Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
* Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

* Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
* Toggle **Return All** to true.
* Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
* Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.

2. The [AI Transform](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/) node. For example, try entering something like:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. The [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

## Column names were updated after the node's setup[#](#column-names-were-updated-after-the-nodes-setup "Permanent link")

You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.

To refresh the column names, re-select **Mapping Column Mode**. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.

Once the column names refresh, update the node parameters.

# Google Sheets Sheet Within Document operations[#](#google-sheets-sheet-within-document-operations "Permanent link")

Use this operation to create, update, clear or delete a sheet in a Google spreadsheet from Google Sheets. Refer to [Google Sheets](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/) for more information on the Google Sheets node itself.

## Append or Update Row[#](#append-or-update-row "Permanent link")

Use this operation to update an existing row or add a new row at the end of the data if a matching entry isn't found in a sheet.

Enter these parameters:

* **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [Google Sheets credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
* **Resource**: Select **Sheet Within Document**.
* **Operation**: Select **Append or Update Row**.
* **Document**: Choose a spreadsheet that contains the sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.
  + Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`.
  + You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.
* **Sheet**: Choose a sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.
  + Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the sheet title.
  + You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.
* **Mapping Column Mode**:
  + **Map Each Column Manually**: Enter **Values to Send** for each column.
  + **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)
  + **Nothing**: Don't map any data.

### Options[#](#options "Permanent link")

* **Cell Format**: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to [Google Sheets API | CellFormat](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells#CellFormat) for more information.
  + **Let Google Sheets format** (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings.
  + **Let n8n format**: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.
* **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option when you need to specify the data range on your sheet.
  + **Header Row**: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.
  + **First Data Row**: Specify the row index where the actual data starts.
* **Handling extra fields in input**: When using **Mapping Column Mode > Map Automatically**, use this option to decide how to handle fields in the input data that don't match any existing columns in the sheet.
  + **Insert in New Column(s)** (default): Adds new columns for any extra data.
  + **Ignore Them**: Ignores extra data that don't match the existing columns.
  + **Error**: Throws an error and stops execution.
* **Use Append**: Turn on this option to use the [Google API append endpoint](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values#append_values) for adding new data rows.
  + By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.
  + Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps.

# Google Drive node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#google-drive-node-common-issues)







# Google Drive node common issues[#](#google-drive-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app[#](#google-hasnt-verified-this-app "Permanent link")

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized[#](#google-cloud-app-becoming-unauthorized "Permanent link")

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

## Google Drive OAuth error[#](#google-drive-oauth-error "Permanent link")

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive[#](#get-recent-files-from-google-drive "Permanent link")

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
2. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
3. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
4. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
5. In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.
6. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
7. Choose **Simple** sort type.
8. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
9. Choose **Descending** sort order.
10. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
11. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
12. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
13. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
14. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
15. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

# Gmail node common issues[#](#gmail-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages[#](#remove-the-n8n-attribution-from-sent-messages "Permanent link")

If you're using the node to [send a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#send-options) and [Reply options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials[#](#forbidden-perhaps-check-your-credentials "Permanent link")

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The error most often displays when you're using a Google Service Account as the credential and the credential doesn't have **Impersonate a User** turned on.

Refer to [Google Service Account: Finish your n8n credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/#finish-your-n8n-credential) for more information.

## 401 unauthorized error[#](#401-unauthorized-error "Permanent link")

The full text of the error looks like this:


| ``` 1 ``` | ``` 401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}  ``` |
| --- | --- |


This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Gmail API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
2. For [Service Account](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   2. Make sure you add the Gmail API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Bad request - please check your parameters[#](#bad-request-please-check-your-parameters "Permanent link")

This error most often occurs if you enter a Message ID, Thread ID, or Label ID that doesn't exist.

Try a **Get** operation with the ID to confirm it exists.

# Discord node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#discord-node-common-issues)







# Discord node common issues[#](#discord-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds[#](#add-extra-fields-to-embeds "Permanent link")

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` {     "author": "My Name", 	"url": "https://discord.js.org", 	"fields": [ 		{ 			"name": "Regular field title", 			"value": "Some value here" 		} 	], 	"footer": { 		"text": "Some footer text here", 		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png" 	} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages  ``` |
| --- | --- |

In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` { 	"content": "Test", 	"embeds": [ 		{ 			"author": "My Name", 			"url": "https://discord.js.org", 			"fields": [ 				{ 					"name": "Regular field title", 					"value": "Some value here" 				} 			], 			"footer": { 				"text": "Some footer text here", 				"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png" 			} 		} 	] }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Mention users and channels[#](#mention-users-and-channels "Permanent link")

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

* **User**: `<@USER_ID>`
* **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
* **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`

# Airtable node common issues[#](#airtable-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Airtable node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials[#](#forbidden-perhaps-check-your-credentials "Permanent link")

This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.

Refer to the [Airtable credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.

## Service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you "Permanent link")

Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.

If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.

You can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits). If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the [handling rate limits](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/) page.

## Node reference[#](#node-reference "Permanent link")

### Get the Record ID[#](#get-the-record-id "Permanent link")

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable[#](#create-a-record-id-column-in-airtable "Permanent link")

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation[#](#use-the-list-operation "Permanent link")

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation[#](#filter-records-when-using-the-list-operation "Permanent link")

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/





[Skip to content](#workflow-trigger-node)







# Workflow Trigger node[#](#workflow-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

Deprecated

n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/).


Keep in mind

If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

* **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
* **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.

# Webhook node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#common-issues-and-questions)







# Common issues and questions[#](#common-issues-and-questions "Permanent link")

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods[#](#listen-for-multiple-http-methods "Permanent link")

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

1. Open the node **Settings**.
2. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
3. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node[#](#use-the-http-request-node-to-trigger-the-webhook-node "Permanent link")

The [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
3. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
4. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
5. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
6. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node[#](#use-curl-to-trigger-the-webhook-node "Permanent link")

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.

Note

In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.  

The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.
## Send a response of type string[#](#send-a-response-of-type-string "Permanent link")

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
2. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
3. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
4. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
5. Connect an [Edit Fields node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.
6. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
7. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
8. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
9. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL[#](#test-url-versus-production-url "Permanent link")

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

| **URL type** | **How to trigger** | **Listening duration** | **Data shown in editor UI?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test URL | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds | ‚úÖ |
| Production URL | Activate the workflow | Until workflow deactivated | ‚ùå |

Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information.

## IPs in Whitelist are failing to connect[#](#ips-in-whitelist-are-failing-to-connect "Permanent link")

If you're unable to connect from IPs in your IP Whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.

# Webhook node workflow development documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/





[Skip to content](#workflow-development)







# Workflow development[#](#workflow-development "Permanent link")

The [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows[#](#build-and-test-workflows "Permanent link")

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](/hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

* [npm with tunnel](/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)
* [Docker with tunnel](/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)

## Production workflows[#](#production-workflows "Permanent link")

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](/workflows/create/) for more information on activating workflows.

# Wait | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/





[Skip to content](#wait)







# Wait[#](#wait "Permanent link")

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

* [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.
* [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.
* [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
* [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval[#](#after-time-interval "Permanent link")

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

* **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.
* **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
  + **Seconds**
  + **Minutes**
  + **Hours**
  + **Days**

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time[#](#at-specified-time "Permanent link")

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.

### On Webhook Call[#](#on-webhook-call "Permanent link")

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

#### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

* **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
* **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
* **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
* **None**: Don't use authentication.

Auth reference

Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#authentication) for more information on each auth type.

#### HTTP Method[#](#http-method "Permanent link")

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.

#### Response Code[#](#response-code "Permanent link")

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

#### Respond[#](#respond "Permanent link")

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

* **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
  + **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
    - **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
    - **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
    - **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
    - **No Response Body**: Return with no body.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Limit Wait Time[#](#limit-wait-time "Permanent link")

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
  + **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
    - Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
    - Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
  + **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
    - **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options[#](#on-webhook-call-options "Permanent link")

* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
* **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
* **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations[#](#on-webhook-call-limitations "Permanent link")

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

* Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted[#](#on-form-submitted "Permanent link")

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

#### Form Title[#](#form-title "Permanent link")

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description[#](#form-description "Permanent link")

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

* **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
* **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
  + **Date**
  + **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
    - **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
  + **Number**
  + **Password**
  + **Text**
  + **Textarea**
* **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

#### Respond When[#](#respond-when "Permanent link")

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

* **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
* **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.

#### Limit Wait Time[#](#limit-wait-time_1 "Permanent link")

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set:
\* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
\* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
\* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
\* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
\* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
\* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options[#](#on-form-response-options "Permanent link")

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

* **Rules**: Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
* **Expression**: Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.

Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

### Rules[#](#rules "Permanent link")

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

* Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
  + Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
  + The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
* **Rename Output**: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.

Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

#### Rule options[#](#rule-options "Permanent link")

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options**:

* **Fallback Output**: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
  + **None**: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
  + **Extra Output**: Send items to an extra, separate output.
  + **Output 0**: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
* **Ignore Case**: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
* **Less Strict Type Validation**: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Send data to all matching outputs**: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).

### Expression[#](#expression "Permanent link")

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

* **Number of Outputs**: Set how many outputs the node should have.
* **Output Index**: Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.

# Summarize | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/





[Skip to content](#summarize)







# Summarize[#](#summarize "Permanent link")

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Fields to Summarize[#](#fields-to-summarize "Permanent link")

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

* **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
  + **Append**: Append
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
  + **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
  + **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
    - **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
  + **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
  + **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
  + **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
  + **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
  + **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
* **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By[#](#fields-to-split-by "Permanent link")

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

### Continue if Field Not Found[#](#continue-if-field-not-found "Permanent link")

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation[#](#disable-dot-notation "Permanent link")

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format[#](#output-format "Permanent link")

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
* **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by[#](#ignore-items-without-valid-fields-to-group-by "Permanent link")

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Schedule Trigger node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#schedule-trigger-node-common-issues)







# Schedule Trigger node common issues[#](#schedule-trigger-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression[#](#invalid-cron-expression "Permanent link")

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

* That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/#custom-cron-interval)
* That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time[#](#scheduled-workflows-run-at-the-wrong-time "Permanent link")

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally[#](#adjust-the-timezone-globally "Permanent link")

If you're using [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](/hosting/), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow[#](#adjust-the-timezone-for-an-individual-workflow "Permanent link")

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
2. Select the ![three dots menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Change the **Timezone** setting.
5. Select **Save**.

### Variables not working as expected[#](#variables-not-working-as-expected "Permanent link")

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.

### Changing the trigger interval[#](#changing-the-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.

Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

# Schedule Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/





[Skip to content](#schedule-trigger-node)







# Schedule Trigger node[#](#schedule-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

You must activate the workflow

If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.


Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information.
2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).
## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

* [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)
* [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)
* [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)
* [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)
* [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)
* [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)
* [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval[#](#seconds-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval[#](#minutes-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval[#](#hours-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval[#](#days-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.

### Weeks trigger interval[#](#weeks-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval[#](#months-trigger-interval "Permanent link")

* **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval[#](#custom-cron-interval "Permanent link")

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples[#](#examples "Permanent link")

| Type | Cron Expression | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every X Seconds | `*/10 * * * * *` | Every 10 seconds. |
| Every X Minutes | `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes. |
| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Every hour on the hour. |
| Daily | `0 6 * * *` | At 6:00 AM every day. |
| Weekly | `0 12 * * 1` | At noon every Monday. |
| Monthly | `0 0 1 * *` | At midnight on the 1st of every month. |
| Every X Days | `0 0 */3 * *` | At midnight every 3rd day. |
| Only Weekdays | `0 9 * * 1-5` | At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday. |
| Custom Hourly Range | `0 9-17 * * *` | Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. |
| Quarterly | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. |


Using variables in the Cron expression

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to **Inactive** and then back to **Active** again

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression[#](#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression "Permanent link")

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| (\*) | \* | \* | \* | \* | \* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (second) | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week(Sun-Sat) |

# Respond to Webhook | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/





[Skip to content](#respond-to-webhook)







# Respond to Webhook[#](#respond-to-webhook "Permanent link")

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.

Runs once for the first data item

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated) for more information.

## How to use Respond to Webhook[#](#how-to-use-respond-to-webhook "Permanent link")

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

1. Add a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
2. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
3. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

### Respond With[#](#respond-with "Permanent link")

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

* **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
* **Binary**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
* **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
* **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
* **No Data**: No response payload.
* **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
* **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

* **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use.
* **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.
* **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.

## Workflow behavior[#](#workflow-behavior "Permanent link")

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

* The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
* The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
* A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
* A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)[#](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated "Permanent link")

Deprecated in 1.22.0

n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](/code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

* Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
* Use the [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**.

* The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
* **Replace With**: Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
* You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
  + **Case Insensitive**: Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
  + **Max Depth**: Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.

Regex impacts

Using a regular expression can affect any keys that match the expression, including keys you've already renamed.

# Webhook node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/





[Skip to content](#webhook-node)







# Webhook node[#](#webhook-node "Permanent link")

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for build a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process[#](#workflow-development-process "Permanent link")

n8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Webhook URLs[#](#webhook-urls "Permanent link")

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png)

Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab


* **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Test workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### HTTP Method[#](#http-method "Permanent link")

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):

* DELETE
* GET
* HEAD
* PATCH
* POST
* PUT
  
  Webhook max payload
  
  The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB.
  If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.

### Path[#](#path "Permanent link")

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

* `/:variable`
* `/path/:variable`
* `/:variable/path`
* `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
* `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

* Basic auth
* Header auth
* JWT auth
* None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webhook/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Respond[#](#respond "Permanent link")

* **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

### Response Code[#](#response-code "Permanent link")

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

### Response Data[#](#response-data "Permanent link")

Choose what data to include in the response body:

* **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
* **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
* **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
* **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

* **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
* **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
* **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
* **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
* **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
* **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.
* **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
* **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

| Option | Required node configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Allowed Origins (CORS) | Any |
| Binary Property | Either: HTTP Method > POST  HTTP Method > PATCH  HTTP Method > PUT |
| Ignore Bots | Any |
| IP(s) Whitelist | Any |
| Property Name | Both:  Respond > When Last Node Finishes  Response Data > First Entry JSON |
| No Response Body | Respond > Immediately |
| Raw Body | Any |
| Response Code | Any except Respond > Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node |
| Response Content-Type | Both:  Respond > When Last Node Finishes  Response Data > First Entry JSON |

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Taylor Swift | Pop star | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |

Items are only compared against previous executions

The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input *and* across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
6. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains the one new record from the Code node:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | Tom Hanks | Actor | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |

| 8 | Rihanna | Pop star | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
8. Select **Test step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value[#](#keep-items-where-the-value-is-higher-than-any-previous-value "Permanent link")

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.id }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Madonna" and "Bob Dylan."
6. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Bob Dylan." n8n keeps this item because its `id` column value (15) is higher than any previous values (the previous maximum value was 9):

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 | Bob Dylan | Folk singer | 2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the 13 items with an `id` column value equal to or less than the previous maximum value (9). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Madonna" because its `id` value isn't larger than the previous maximum value:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Harry Nilsson" and "Kylie Minogue."

6. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Kylie Minogue." n8n keeps this item because its `last_updated` column value (`2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z`) is later than any previous values (the previous latest date was `2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`):

The **Discarded** tab contains the 15 items with a `last_updated` column value equal to or earlier than the previous latest date (`2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Harry Nilsson" because its `last_updated` value isn't later than the previous maximum value:

| **id** | **name** | **job** | **last\_updated** |

# Remove Duplicates node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/





[Skip to content](#remove-duplicates-node)







# Remove Duplicates node[#](#remove-duplicates-node "Permanent link")

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

* identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
* identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

Major changes in 1.64.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).

## Operation modes[#](#operation-modes "Permanent link")

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

* **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
* **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
* **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input "Permanent link")

When you set the "Operations" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input-parameters "Permanent link")

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
  + **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.
  + **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
  + **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input-options "Permanent link")

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
* **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions "Permanent link")

When you set the "Operation" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions-parameters "Permanent link")

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

* **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:
  
  + **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
  + **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
  + **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.
* **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:
  
  + When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
  + When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
  + When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions-options "Permanent link")

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
  + **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
  + **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use "workflow" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to "node" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

* **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History[#](#clear-deduplication-history "Permanent link")

When you set the "Operation" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the "Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters[#](#clear-deduplication-history-parameters "Permanent link")

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
  + **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options[#](#clear-deduplication-history-options "Permanent link")

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
  + **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
  + **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples "Permanent link")

For templates using the Remove Duplicates node and examples of how to use it, refer to [Templates and examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/templates-and-examples/).

# n8n Form node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/





[Skip to content](#n8n-form-node)







# n8n Form node[#](#n8n-form-node "Permanent link")

Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)
## Setting up the node[#](#setting-up-the-node "Permanent link")

### Set default selections with query parameters[#](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters "Permanent link")

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

Only for production

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.


When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
  + `name`: `Jane Doe`
  + `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

### Defining the form using JSON[#](#defining-the-form-using-json "Permanent link")

Use **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](/data/data-structure). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:

* `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field.
* `fieldType`: Choose from `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `text`, or `textarea`.
  + Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  + When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.
  + When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
* `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.
* `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.

An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 ``` | ``` // Use the "requiredField" key on any field to mark it as mandatory // Use the "placeholder" key to specify placeholder data for all fields //     except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file'  [ 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Date Field", 		"fieldType": "date", 		"formatDate": "mm/dd/yyyy", // how to format received date in n8n 		"requiredField": true 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Dropdown Options", 		"fieldType": "dropdown", 		"fieldOptions": { 			"values": [ 				{ 					"option": "option 1" 				}, 				{ 					"option": "option 2" 				} 			] 		}, 		"requiredField": true 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Multiselect", 		"fieldType": "dropdown", 		"fieldOptions": { 			"values": [ 				{ 					"option": "option 1" 				}, 				{ 					"option": "option 2" 				} 			] 		}, 		"multiselect": true // setting to true allows multi-select 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Email", 		"fieldType": "email", 		"placeholder": "me@mail.con" 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "File", 		"fieldType": "file", 		"multipleFiles": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection 		"acceptFileTypes": ".jpg, .png" // allowed file types 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Number", 		"fieldType": "number" 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Password", 		"fieldType": "password" 	}, 	{ 		// "fieldType": "text" can be omitted since it's the default type 		"fieldLabel": "Text" 	}, 	{ 		"fieldLabel": "Textarea", 		"fieldType": "textarea" 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Form Ending[#](#form-ending "Permanent link")

Use the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page or redirect the user to a URL. Only one Form Ending page is displayed per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.

Choose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:

* **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
  + Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
  + n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
  + Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.

When using **Redirect to URL**, fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.

### Forms with branches[#](#forms-with-branches "Permanent link")

The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.

#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches[#](#workflows-with-mutually-exclusive-branches "Permanent link")

Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.

This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)
#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches[#](#workflows-that-may-execute-multiple-branches "Permanent link")

Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.

n8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.

This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json)
### Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

* **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.
* **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
* **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.

## Running the node[#](#running-the-node "Permanent link")

### Build and test workflows[#](#build-and-test-workflows "Permanent link")

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

* Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
* Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

### Production workflows[#](#production-workflows "Permanent link")

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

[Skip to content](#manual-trigger-node)







# Manual Trigger node[#](#manual-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Test Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

Use this trigger:

* To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
* When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow[#](#only-one-manual-trigger-node-is-allowed-in-a-workflow "Permanent link")

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

# HTTP Request node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#http-request-node-common-issues)







# HTTP Request node common issues[#](#http-request-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters[#](#bad-request-please-check-your-parameters "Permanent link")

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

* You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
* You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

## The resource you are requesting could not be found[#](#the-resource-you-are-requesting-could-not-be-found "Permanent link")

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON[#](#json-parameter-need-to-be-an-valid-json "Permanent link")

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

* Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
* If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:
  
  | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {{     {     "myjson":     {         "name1": "value1",         "name2": "value2",         "array1":             ["value1","value2"]     }     } }}  ``` |
  | --- | --- |

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials[#](#forbidden-perhaps-check-your-credentials "Permanent link")

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

* Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
* Format your generic credential in a different way.
* Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#429-the-service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you "Permanent link")

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

### Batching[#](#batching "Permanent link")

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
2. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
3. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

### Retry on Fail[#](#retry-on-fail "Permanent link")

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
2. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
3. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`.

[Skip to content](#http-request-node)







# HTTP Request node[#](#http-request-node "Permanent link")

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API.

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Method[#](#method "Permanent link")

Select the method to use for the request:

* DELETE
* GET
* HEAD
* OPTIONS
* PATCH
* POST
* PUT

### URL[#](#url "Permanent link")

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials[#](#predefined-credentials "Permanent link")

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

#### Generic credentials[#](#generic-credentials "Permanent link")

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.

You can select one of the following methods:

* Basic auth
* Custom auth
* Digest auth
* Header auth
* OAuth1 API
* OAuth2 API
* Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters[#](#send-query-parameters "Permanent link")

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Headers[#](#send-headers "Permanent link")

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Body[#](#send-body "Permanent link")

If you need to send a body with your API request, turn this option on.

Then select the **Body Content Type** that best matches the format for the body content you wish to send.

#### Form URLencoded[#](#form-urlencoded "Permanent link")

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Array Format in Query Parameters[#](#array-format-in-query-parameters "Permanent link")

Option availability

This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

* **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
* **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
* **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

### Batching[#](#batching "Permanent link")

* **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
* **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues[#](#ignore-ssl-issues "Permanent link")

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers[#](#lowercase-headers "Permanent link")

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

### Redirects[#](#redirects "Permanent link")

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

### Response[#](#response "Permanent link")

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

* **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
* **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
* **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
  + **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
  + **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
  + **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
  + **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

### Pagination[#](#pagination "Permanent link")

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

Inspect the API data first

Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.


Understand pagination

Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.

For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.

If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

* **Pagination Mode**:
  + **Off**: Turn off pagination.
  + **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
  + **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$pageCount` | The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched. |
| `$request` | The request object sent by the HTTP node. |
| `$response` | The response object from the HTTP call. Includes `$response.body`, `$response.headers`, and `$response.statusCode`. The contents of `body` and `headers` depend on the data sent by the API. |

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

* Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
* Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
* The structure of the data that the API returns.
### Proxy[#](#proxy "Permanent link")

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use.

### Timeout[#](#timeout "Permanent link")

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

## Import curl command[#](#import-curl-command "Permanent link")

[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
2. Paste your curl command into the text box.
3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

# HTML | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/





[Skip to content](#html)







# HTML[#](#html "Permanent link")

The HTML node provides operations to help you work with HTML in n8n.

HTML Extract node

The HTML node replaces the HTML Extract node from version 0.213.0 on. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [HTML Extract node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/86fe33b681621e618e3adcab9a27e8605dbc23ad/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.htmlextract.md).


Cross-site scripting

When using the HTML node to generate an HTML template you can introduce [XSS (cross-site scripting)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). This is a security risk. Be careful with un-trusted inputs.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

* [**Generate HTML template**](#generate-html-template): Use this operation to create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.
* [**Extract HTML content**](#extract-html-content): Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).
* [**Convert to HTML Table**](#convert-to-html-table): Convert content to an HTML table.

The node parameters and options depend on the operation you select. Refer to the sections below for more details on configuring each operation.

## Generate HTML template[#](#generate-html-template "Permanent link")

Create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.

You can include:

* Standard HTML
* CSS in `<style>` tags.
* JavaScript in `<script>` tags. n8n doesn't execute the JavaScript.
* Expressions, wrapped in `{{}}`.

You can use [Expressions](/code/expressions/) in the template, including n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/).

## Extract HTML Content[#](#extract-html-content "Permanent link")

Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).

Use these parameters:

### Source Data[#](#source-data "Permanent link")

Select the source type for your HTML content. Choose between:

* **JSON**: If you select this source data, enter the **JSON Property**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.
* **Binary**: If you select this source data, enter the **Input Binary Field**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.

### Extraction Values[#](#extraction-values "Permanent link")

* **Key**: Enter the key to save the extracted value under.
* **CSS Selector**: Enter the CSS selector to search for.
* **Return Value**: Select the type of data to return. Choose from:
  + **Attribute**: Return an attribute value like `class` from an element.
    - If you select this option, enter the name of the **Attribute** to return the value of.
  + **HTML**: Return the HTML that the element contains.
  + **Text**: Return the text content of the element.
    - If you choose this option, you can also enter a comma-separated list of selectors to skip in the **Skip Selectors**.
  + **Value**: Return the value of an input, select, or text area.
* **Return Array**: Choose whether to return multiple extraction values as an array (turned on) or as a single string (turned off).

### Extract HTML Content options[#](#extract-html-content-options "Permanent link")

You can also configure this operation with these options:

* **Trim Values**: Controls whether to remove all spaces and newlines from the beginning and end of the values (turned on) or leaves them (turned off).
* **Clean Up Text**: Controls whether to remove leading whitespaces, trailing whitespaces, and line breaks (newlines) and condense multiple consecutive whitespaces into a single space (turned on) or to leave them as-is (turned off).

## Convert to HTML Table[#](#convert-to-html-table "Permanent link")

This operation expects data from another node. It has no parameters. It includes these options:

* **Capitalize Headers**: Controls whether to capitalize the table's headers (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Custom Styling**: Controls whether to use custom styling (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Caption**: Enter a caption to add to the table.
* **Table Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the `<table>`, such as style attributes.
* **Header Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's headers `<th>`.
* **Row Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's rows `<tr>`.

# n8n Form Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/





[Skip to content](#n8n-form-trigger-node)







# n8n Form Trigger node[#](#n8n-form-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.

## Build and test workflows[#](#build-and-test-workflows "Permanent link")

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

* Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
* Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows[#](#production-workflows "Permanent link")

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters[#](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters "Permanent link")

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

Only for production

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.


When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
  + `name`: `Jane Doe`
  + `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

These are the main node configuration fields:

### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

* **Basic Auth**
* **None**

#### Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
* The **Password** that goes with that username.

### Form URLs[#](#form-urls "Permanent link")

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

![Screenshot of the form URLs](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)

* **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Form Path[#](#form-path "Permanent link")

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title[#](#form-title "Permanent link")

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description[#](#form-description "Permanent link")

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.

### Form Fields[#](#form-fields "Permanent link")

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Field** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

* **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field.
* **Field Type**: Choose from **Date**, **Dropdown List**, **Email**, **File**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
  + Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  + Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**.
* **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.

### Respond When[#](#respond-when "Permanent link")

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

* **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
* **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

* **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
* **Form Response**: Choose how to respond when the user submits the form.
  + **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text**: Show a message to the user.
  + **Respond With** > **Redirect URL**: Send the user to a new page.
* **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
* **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.

# Merge | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/





[Skip to content](#merge)







# Merge[#](#merge "Permanent link")

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

Major changes in 0.194.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md).


Minor changes in 1.49.0

n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**:

### Append[#](#append "Permanent link")

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.

![Sample Append mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left, one with items A, B, C and one with items D, E, F. The final data source combines both and lists A, B, C, D, E, F.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/append-diagram.png)

Append mode inputs and output


### Combine[#](#combine "Permanent link")

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

#### Matching Fields[#](#matching-fields "Permanent link")

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**.

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

* **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
* **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.
* **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
* **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
* **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by matching fields.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-field-diagram.png)

Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output


#### Position[#](#position "Permanent link")

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by index position.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-position-diagram.png)

Combine by Position mode inputs and output


#### All Possible Combinations[#](#all-possible-combinations "Permanent link")

Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png)

Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output


#### Combine mode options[#](#combine-mode-options "Permanent link")

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:

* **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.
* **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `"3"` and `3` as the same.
* **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
* **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
  + **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
  + **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
* **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.

##### Clash Handling[#](#clash-handling "Permanent link")

If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named `language`, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if `language` has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.

You can change this behavior by selecting **Options** > **Clash Handling**:

* **When Field Values Clash**: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose **Always Add Input Number to Field Names** to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.
* **Merging Nested Fields**
  + **Deep Merge**: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.
  + **Shallow Merge**: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.

### SQL Query[#](#sql-query "Permanent link")

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data.

Example:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements) for a full list of supported SQL statements.

### Choose Branch[#](#choose-branch "Permanent link")

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:

* The **Input 1 Data**
* The **Input 2 Data**
* **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items[#](#merging-data-streams-with-uneven-numbers-of-items "Permanent link")

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes[#](#branch-execution-with-if-and-merge-nodes "Permanent link")

0.236.0 and below

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

![Screenshot of a workflow. The workflow has an Edit Fields node, followed by an If node. It ends with a Merge node.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-node.png)

## Try it out: A step by step example[#](#try-it-out-a-step-by-step-example "Permanent link")

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.

### Set up sample data using the Code nodes[#](#set-up-sample-data-using-the-code-nodes "Permanent link")

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.
2. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` return [   {     json: {       name: 'Stefan',       language: 'de',     }   },   {     json: {       name: 'Jim',       language: 'en',     }   },   {     json: {       name: 'Hans',       language: 'de',     }   } ];  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.
4. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` return [ 	  {     json: {       greeting: 'Hello',       language: 'en',     }   },   {     json: {       greeting: 'Hallo',       language: 'de',     }   } ];  ``` |
   | --- | --- |

### Try out different merge modes[#](#try-out-different-merge-modes "Permanent link")

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/655-merge-greetings-with-the-users-based-on-the-language/)

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

#### Append[#](#append_1 "Permanent link")

Select **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de |  |
| Jim | en |  |
| Hans | de |  |
|  | en | Hello |
|  | de | Hallo |

#### Combine by Matching Fields[#](#combine-by-matching-fields "Permanent link")

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
2. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
3. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
4. Select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello |
| Hans | de | Hallo |

#### Combine by Position[#](#combine-by-position "Permanent link")

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo |

##### Keep unpaired items[#](#keep-unpaired-items "Permanent link")

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo |
| Hans | de |  |

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations[#](#combine-by-all-possible-combinations "Permanent link")

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello |

[Skip to content](#loop-over-items)







# Loop Over Items[#](#loop-over-items "Permanent link")

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all the data and returns it through the **done** output.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Batch Size[#](#batch-size "Permanent link")

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

### Reset[#](#reset "Permanent link")

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop.

Check if you need this node

n8n automatically processes incoming items. You may not need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. To learn more about how n8n handles multiple items, refer to the documentation on [Looping in n8n](/flow-logic/looping/).

### Read RSS feed from two different sources[#](#read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources "Permanent link")

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/) on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](/try-it-out/).

The final workflow looks like this:

![A workflow with the Loop Over Items node](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/splitinbatches/workflow.png)

1. Add the manual trigger.
2. Add the Code node.
3. Copy this code into the Code node:
   
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` return [ 	{ 		json: { 			url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io', 		} 	}, 	{ 		json: { 			url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n', 		} 	} ];  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
4. Add the Loop Over Items node.
5. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.
6. Add the RSS Feed Read node.
7. Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.
8. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
9. Select **Test Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items[#](#check-that-the-node-has-processed-all-items "Permanent link")

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["noItemsLeft"]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node[#](#get-the-current-running-index-of-the-node "Permanent link")

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}`.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filter/





[Skip to content](#filter)







# Filter[#](#filter "Permanent link")

Filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Create filter comparison **Conditions** to perform your filter.

* Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
* The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.

Select **Add condition** to create more conditions.

### Combining conditions[#](#combining-conditions "Permanent link")

You can choose to keep items:

* When they meet all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **AND** in the dropdown between them.
* When they meet any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **OR** in the dropdown between them.

You can't create a mix of AND and OR rules.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Ignore Case**: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
* **Less Strict Type Validation**: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.

# Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/





[Skip to content](#execute-sub-workflow-trigger-node)







# Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node[#](#execute-sub-workflow-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

* Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
* Break large workflows into smaller components.

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node.

### Create the sub-workflow[#](#create-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Create a new workflow.
   
   Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
   
   You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.
2. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
   
   1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
   * **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide.
   * **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   * **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
6. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.


Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
3. In the sub-workflow [settings](/workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/).
6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow[#](#call-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
   
   Find your workflow ID
   
   Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows[#](#how-data-passes-between-workflows "Permanent link")

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

# Execute Sub-workflow[#](#execute-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Source[#](#source "Permanent link")

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

* **Database**: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
  + **From list**: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
  + **Workflow ID**: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
* **Local File**: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
  + **Workflow Path**: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
* **Parameter**: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
  + **Workflow JSON**: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
* **URL**: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
  + **Workflow URL**: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

### Workflow Inputs[#](#workflow-inputs "Permanent link")

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

### Mode[#](#mode "Permanent link")

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

* **Run once with all items**: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
* **Run once for each item**: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

[Skip to content](#execute-command-node-common-issues)







# Execute Command node common issues[#](#execute-command-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found[#](#command-failed-command-binsh-command-not-found "Permanent link")

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

* Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
* Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n.
* If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your command.
  + If n8n is already running:
    
    | ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column docker ps | grep n8n # Try to execute the command within the running container docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>  ``` |
    | --- | --- |
  + If n8n isn't running:
    
    | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n # Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>  ``` |
    | --- | --- |

## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded[#](#error-stdout-maxbuffer-length-exceeded "Permanent link")

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.

# Execute Command | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/





[Skip to content](#execute-command)







# Execute Command[#](#execute-command "Permanent link")

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

Which shell runs the command?

This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.


Not available on Cloud

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the node using the following parameters.

### Execute Once[#](#execute-once "Permanent link")

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

### Command[#](#command "Permanent link")

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).

#### Run multiple commands[#](#run-multiple-commands "Permanent link")

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

* Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.
  
  | ``` 1 ``` | ``` cd bin && ls  ``` |
  | --- | --- |
* Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.
  
  | ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` cd bin ls  ``` |
  | --- | --- |

#### Run cURL command[#](#run-curl-command "Permanent link")

You can also use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.
2. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.
   
   | ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n USER root RUN apk --update add curl USER node  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
3. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker build -t n8n-curl  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
4. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.
5. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

[Skip to content](#error-trigger-node)







# Error Trigger node[#](#error-trigger-node "Permanent link")

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
2. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
3. Select **Save**.
4. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.
   2. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   3. Select **Save**.
      Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

Note the following:

* If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
* If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
* You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"execution": { 			"id": "231", 			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231", 			"retryOf": "34", 			"error": { 				"message": "Example Error Message", 				"stack": "Stacktrace" 			}, 			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error", 			"mode": "manual" 		}, 		"workflow": { 			"id": "1", 			"name": "Example Workflow" 		} 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

All information is always present, except:

* `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
* `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
* `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` {   "trigger": {     "error": {       "context": {},       "name": "WorkflowActivationError",       "cause": {         "message": "",         "stack": ""       },       "timestamp": 1654609328787,       "message": "",       "node": {         . . .        }     },     "mode": "trigger"   },   "workflow": {     "id": "",     "name": ""   } }  ``` |

# Edit Fields (Set) | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/





[Skip to content](#edit-fields-set)







# Edit Fields (Set)[#](#edit-fields-set "Permanent link")

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

The are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

### Mode[#](#mode "Permanent link")

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

### Fields to Set[#](#fields-to-set "Permanent link")

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

* n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
* The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle.
2. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

### Keep Only Set Fields[#](#keep-only-set-fields "Permanent link")

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output[#](#include-in-output "Permanent link")

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data[#](#include-binary-data "Permanent link")

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors[#](#ignore-type-conversion-errors "Permanent link")

Manual Mapping only.

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation[#](#support-dot-notation "Permanent link")

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` { "number": { "one": 20} }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` { "number.one": 20 }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Arrays and expressions in JSON Output mode[#](#arrays-and-expressions-in-json-output-mode "Permanent link")

You can use arrays and expressions when creating your JSON Output.

For example, given this input data generated by the Customer Datastore node:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 ``` | ``` [   {     "id": "23423532",     "name": "Jay Gatsby",     "email": "gatsby@west-egg.com",     "notes": "Keeps asking about a green light??",     "country": "US",     "created": "1925-04-10"   },   {     "id": "23423533",     "name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a",     "email": "jab@macondo.co",     "notes": "Lots of people named after him. Very confusing",     "country": "CO",     "created": "1967-05-05"   },   {     "id": "23423534",     "name": "Max Sendak",     "email": "info@in-and-out-of-weeks.org",     "notes": "Keeps rolling his terrible eyes",     "country": "US",     "created": "1963-04-09"   },   {     "id": "23423535",     "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",     "email": "captain@heartofgold.com",     "notes": "Felt like I was talking to more than one person",     "country": null,     "created": "1979-10-12"   },   {     "id": "23423536",     "name": "Edmund Pevensie",     "email": "edmund@narnia.gov",     "notes": "Passionate sailor",     "country": "UK",     "created": "1950-10-16"   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Add the following JSON in the **JSON Output** field, with **Include in Output** set to **All Input Fields**:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` {   "newKey": "new value",   "array": [{{ $json.id }},"{{ $json.name }}"],   "object": {     "innerKey1": "new value",     "innerKey2": "{{ $json.id }}",     "innerKey3": "{{ $json.name }}",  } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You get this output:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 ``` | ``` [   {     "id": "23423532",     "name": "Jay Gatsby",     "email": "gatsby@west-egg.com",     "notes": "Keeps asking about a green light??",     "country": "US",     "created": "1925-04-10",     "newKey": "new value",     "array": [       23423532,       "Jay Gatsby"     ],     "object": {       "innerKey1": "new value",       "innerKey2": "23423532",       "innerKey3": "Jay Gatsby"     }   },   {     "id": "23423533",     "name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a",     "email": "jab@macondo.co",     "notes": "Lots of people named after him.

# Date & Time[#](#date-time "Permanent link")

The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.

Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information.
2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

Date and time in other nodes

You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

# Chat Trigger node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#chat-trigger-node-common-issues)







# Chat Trigger node common issues[#](#chat-trigger-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node[#](#pass-data-from-a-website-to-an-embedded-chat-trigger-node "Permanent link")

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` createChat({ 	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL', 	metadata: { 		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA' 	}; });  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's [data processing features](/data/).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages[#](#chat-trigger-node-doesnt-fetch-previous-messages "Permanent link")

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
2. Attach a **Window Buffer Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
3. Attach the same **Window Buffer Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
4. In the **Window Buffer Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
2. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:
   * **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
   * **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
   * **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
     + Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
     + Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
   * **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison[#](#understand-item-comparison "Permanent link")

Item comparison is a two stage process:

1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing[#](#fields-to-skip-comparing "Permanent link")

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 ``` | ``` 	// Input 1 	[ 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Stefan", 				"language":	"de" 			} 		}, 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Jim", 				"language":	"en" 			} 		}, 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Hans", 				"language":	"de" 			} 		} 	] 	// Input 2 		[ 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Sara", 				"language":	"de" 			} 		}, 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Jane", 				"language":	"en" 			} 		}, 		{ 			"person": 			{ 				"name":	"Harriet", 				"language":	"de" 			} 		} 	]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Disable Dot Notation[#](#disable-dot-notation "Permanent link")

Whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).

### Multiple Matches[#](#multiple-matches "Permanent link")

Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.

For example, given these two datasets:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 ``` | ``` 	// Input 1 	[ 		{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "apple", 				"color": "red" 			} 		}, 				{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "apple", 				"color": "red" 			} 		}, 				{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "banana", 				"color": "yellow" 			} 		} 	] 	// Input 2 	[ 		{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "apple", 				"color": "red" 			} 		}, 				{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "apple", 				"color": "red" 			} 		}, 				{ 			"fruit": { 				"type": "banana", 				"color": "yellow" 			} 		} 	]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.

## Understand the output[#](#understand-the-output "Permanent link")

There are four output options:

* **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
* **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
* **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.
* **In B only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

# Code node common issues | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/common-issues/





[Skip to content](#code-node-common-issues)







# Code node common issues[#](#code-node-common-issues "Permanent link")

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Code doesn't return items properly[#](#code-doesnt-return-items-properly "Permanent link")

This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` [   {     "json": { 	  // your data goes here 	}   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

* Read the [data structure](/data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
* Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).

## A 'json' property isn't an object[#](#a-json-property-isnt-an-object "Permanent link")

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` [   {     "json": [ 	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error 	]   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` [   {     "json": { 	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected 	}   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Code doesn't return an object[#](#code-doesnt-return-an-object "Permanent link")

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](/data/data-structure/):

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` [   {     "json": { 	  // your data goes here 	}   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level[#](#import-and-export-may-only-appear-at-the-top-level "Permanent link")

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` // Original code: // import express from "express"; // New code: const express = require("express");  ``` |
| --- | --- |


## Cannot find module '<module>'[#](#cannot-find-module-module "Permanent link")

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

Only for self-hosted

n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/) version.

If you're [self-hosting](/hosting) n8n, follow these steps:

* Install the module into your n8n environment.
  + If you are running n8n with [npm](/hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
  + If you are running n8n with [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your module.
* Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables[#](#using-global-variables "Permanent link")

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

Use Remove Duplicates when possible

If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

# Code node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/





[Skip to content](#code-node)







# Code node[#](#code-node "Permanent link")

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](/code/) section. It includes:

* Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/)
* Guidance on [Handling dates](/code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](/code/cookbook/jmespath/)
* A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](/code/cookbook/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.


Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage[#](#usage "Permanent link")

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode[#](#choose-a-mode "Permanent link")

There are two modes:

* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript[#](#javascript "Permanent link")

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features[#](#supported-javascript-features "Permanent link")

The Code node supports:

* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries[#](#external-libraries "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

* [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
* [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts[#](#keyboard-shortcuts "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts).

## Python[#](#python "Permanent link")

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_1 "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts[#](#keyboard-shortcuts_1 "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts).

## File system and HTTP requests[#](#file-system-and-http-requests "Permanent link")

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n[#](#coding-in-n8n "Permanent link")

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts[#](#key-concepts "Permanent link")

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_2 "Permanent link")

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

* Accessing specific item data
* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
* Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node[#](#use-ai-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.


AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
3. Write your query.
4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

# Aggregate | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/





[Skip to content](#aggregate)







# Aggregate[#](#aggregate "Permanent link")

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

* [**Individual Fields**](#individual-fields): Aggregate individual fields separately.
* [**All Item Data**](#all-item-data): Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields[#](#individual-fields "Permanent link")

* **Input Field Name**: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
* **Rename Field**: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
  + **Output Field Name**: This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

### All Item Data[#](#all-item-data "Permanent link")

* **Put Output in Field**: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
* **Include**: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
  + **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
  + **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
  + **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

You can further configure this node using these **Options**:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
* **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
* **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
* **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

# Activation Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.activationtrigger/





[Skip to content](#activation-trigger-node)







# Activation Trigger node[#](#activation-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

Warning

n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/) and the [Workflow Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.


Keep in mind

If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* Events
  + **Activation**: Run when the workflow gets activated
  + **Start**: Run when n8n starts or restarts
  + **Update**: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active

# Sustainable Use License | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/





[Skip to content](#sustainable-use-license)







# Sustainable Use License[#](#sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

Proprietary licenses for Enterprise

Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.

## License FAQs[#](#license-faqs "Permanent link")

### What license do you use?[#](#what-license-do-you-use "Permanent link")

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-source-code-is-covered-by-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

* Content of branches other than master.
* Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).

### What is the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-is-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

* You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
* You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
* You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?[#](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product "Permanent link")

Our license restricts use to "internal business purposes". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

* White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
* Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

* Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
* Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
* Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
* Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?[#](#can-i-use-n8n-to-act-as-the-back-end-to-power-a-feature-in-my-app "Permanent link")

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot[#](#example-1-sync-acme-app-with-hubspot "Permanent link")

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app[#](#example-2-embed-ai-chatbot-in-acme-app "Permanent link")

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?[#](#what-if-i-want-to-use-n8n-for-something-thats-not-permitted-by-the-license "Permanent link")

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license?[#](#why-dont-you-use-an-open-source-license "Permanent link")

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?[#](#why-did-you-create-a-license "Permanent link")

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use ‚Äì can I still use n8n?[#](#my-company-has-a-policy-against-using-code-that-restricts-commercial-use-can-i-still-use-n8n "Permanent link")

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-happens-to-the-code-i-contribute-to-n8n-in-light-of-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).

### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?[#](#why-did-you-switch-to-the-sustainable-use-license-from-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause "Permanent link")

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?[#](#what-are-the-main-differences-between-the-sustainable-use-license-and-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause "Permanent link")

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source?[#](#is-n8n-open-source "Permanent link")

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?[#](#what-is-fair-code-and-how-does-the-sustainable-use-license-relate-to-it "Permanent link")

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

* Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
* Has its source code openly available.
* Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
* Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?[#](#can-i-use-n8ns-sustainable-use-license-for-my-own-project "Permanent link")

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

[Skip to content](#what-you-can-do)







# What you can do[#](#what-you-can-do "Permanent link")

It's also your responsibility as a customer to ensure you are securing your code and data. This document lists some steps you can take.

## All users[#](#all-users "Permanent link")

* Report security issues and [terms of service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms) violations to security@n8n.io.
* If more than one person uses your n8n instance, set up [User management](/user-management/) and follow the [Best practices](/user-management/best-practices/).
* Use OAuth to connect integrations whenever possible.

## Self-hosted users[#](#self-hosted-users "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, there are additional steps you can take:

* Set up a reverse proxy to handle TLS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
* Ensure data is encrypted at rest by using encrypted partitions, or encryption at the hardware level, and ensuring n8n and its database is written to that location.
* Run a [Security audit](/hosting/logging-monitoring/security-audit/).
* Be aware of the [Risks](/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) when installing community nodes, or choose to disable them.
* Make sure users can't import external modules in the Code node. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
* Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
* For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

### GDPR for self-hosted users[#](#gdpr-for-self-hosted-users "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

### GDPR for self-hosted users[#](#gdpr-for-self-hosted-users "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

## Data collection[#](#data-collection "Permanent link")

n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy).

The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.

### Data collection in self-hosted n8n[#](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.

#### What n8n collects[#](#what-n8n-collects "Permanent link")

* Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)
* Error reports for app crashes and API issues
* The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)
* From node parameters:
  + The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)
  + For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)
* Data around workflow executions:
  + Status
  + The user ID of the user who ran the execution
  + The first time a workflow loads data from an external source
  + The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution
* The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).
* Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)
* Diagnostic information:
  + n8n version
  + Selected settings:
    - DB\_TYPE
    - N8N\_VERSION\_NOTIFICATIONS\_ENABLED
    - N8N\_DISABLE\_PRODUCTION\_MAIN\_PROCESS
    - [Execution variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions)
  + OS, RAM, and CPUs
  + Anonymous instance ID
* IP address

#### What n8n doesn't collect[#](#what-n8n-doesnt-collect "Permanent link")

n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:

* Personally identifiable information (except IP address)
* Credential information
* Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')
* Execution data
* Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)
* Error payloads

#### How collection works[#](#how-collection-works "Permanent link")

Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).

#### Opting out of telemetry[#](#opting-out-of-telemetry "Permanent link")

Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.

To opt out of telemetry events:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false  ``` |
| --- | --- |

See [configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.

### Data collection in n8n Cloud[#](#data-collection-in-n8n-cloud "Permanent link")

n8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).

Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.

### AI in n8n[#](#ai-in-n8n "Permanent link")

To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

#### How n8n uses AI[#](#how-n8n-uses-ai "Permanent link")

To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.

#### When n8n shares data[#](#when-n8n-shares-data "Permanent link")

Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.

#### What n8n shares[#](#what-n8n-shares "Permanent link")

* **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.
* **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.
* **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.
* **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.

#### What n8n doesn't share[#](#what-n8n-doesnt-share "Permanent link")

* **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.
* **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.
* **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

# Chat Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/





[Skip to content](#chat-trigger-node)







# Chat Trigger node[#](#chat-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

Workflow execution usage

Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.


Manual Chat trigger

This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Make Chat Publicly Available[#](#make-chat-publicly-available "Permanent link")

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

### Mode[#](#mode "Permanent link")

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

* **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.
* **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

* **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
* **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.
  + Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
* **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

### Initial Message(s)[#](#initial-messages "Permanent link")

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options[#](#hosted-chat-options "Permanent link")

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)[#](#allowed-origin-cors "Permanent link")

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle[#](#input-placeholder-title-and-subtitle "Permanent link")

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

View screenshot

![Customizable text elements](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/hosted-text-elements.png)

#### Load Previous Session[#](#load-previous-session "Permanent link")

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

View screenshot

![Connect nodes to memory](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode[#](#response-mode "Permanent link")

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat[#](#require-button-click-to-start-chat "Permanent link")

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

View screenshot

![New Conversation button](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/new-conversation-button.png)

### Embedded chat options[#](#embedded-chat-options "Permanent link")

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)[#](#allowed-origin-cors_1 "Permanent link")

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session[#](#load-previous-session_1 "Permanent link")

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

View screenshot

![Connect nodes to memory](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode[#](#response-mode_1 "Permanent link")

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

View n8n's [Advanced AI](/advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Set the chat response manually[#](#set-the-chat-response-manually "Permanent link")

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

# n8n v1.0 migration guide | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/1-0-migration-checklist/





[Skip to content](#n8n-v10-migration-guide)







# n8n v1.0 migration guide[#](#n8n-v10-migration-guide "Permanent link")

This document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.

The release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.

## New features[#](#new-features "Permanent link")

### Python support in the Code node[#](#python-support-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](/code/code-node/) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.

[PR #4295](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4295), [PR #6209](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6209)

### Execution order[#](#execution-order "Permanent link")

n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:

In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.

n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.

Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).

[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238), [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246), [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507)

## Deprecations[#](#deprecations "Permanent link")

### MySQL and MariaDB[#](#mysql-and-mariadb "Permanent link")

n8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.

[PR #6189](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6189)

### EXECUTIONS\_PROCESS and "own" mode[#](#executions_process-and-own-mode "Permanent link")

Previously, you could use the `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the `main` process or in their `own` processes. This option and `own` mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, `main` will be the new default.

Note that executions start much faster in `main` mode than in `own` mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) to distribute executions among multiple workers.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)

## Breaking changes[#](#breaking-changes "Permanent link")

### Docker[#](#docker "Permanent link")

#### Permissions change[#](#permissions-change "Permanent link")

When using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user `node` instead of `root`. This change increases security.

If permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n  ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### Image removal[#](#image-removal "Permanent link")

We've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.

#### Entrypoint change[#](#entrypoint-change "Permanent link")

The entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`

[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365)

### Workflow failures due to expression errors[#](#workflow-failures-due-to-expression-errors "Permanent link")

Workflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an "error workflow" under workflow settings.

[PR #6352](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6352)

### Mandatory owner account[#](#mandatory-owner-account "Permanent link")

This change makes [User Management](/user-management/) mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on [n8n.cloud](http://n8n.cloud/) or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.

[PR #6362](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6362)

### Directory for installing custom nodes[#](#directory-for-installing-custom-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global `node_modules` directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`.
If you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.

[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396)

### WebSockets[#](#websockets "Permanent link")

The `N8N_PUSH_BACKEND` environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: `sse` and `websocket`. Starting with n8n 1.0, `websocket` is the default method.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)

### Date transformation functions[#](#date-transformation-functions "Permanent link")

n8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript `Date` or a Luxon `DateTime` object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a `Date`, it returns a `Date`. Similarly, if you call it on a `DateTime` object, it returns a `DateTime` object.

To identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this [utility workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1929-v1-helper-find-params-with-affected-expressions/).

For more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the [official documentation](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/).

[PR #6435](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6435)

### Execution data retention[#](#execution-data-retention "Permanent link")

Starting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under "Workflow Settings," or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.

[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577)

### Removed N8N\_USE\_DEPRECATED\_REQUEST\_LIB[#](#removed-n8n_use_deprecated_request_lib "Permanent link")

The legacy `request` library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the `N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB` environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new `HttpRequest` interface.

If you build custom nodes, refer to [HTTP request helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information on migrating to the new interface.

[PR #6413](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6413)

### Removed WEBHOOK\_TUNNEL\_URL[#](#removed-webhook_tunnel_url "Permanent link")

As of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` configuration option to `WEBHOOK_URL`. In n8n 1.0, `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to [the docs](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/).

[PR #1408](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1408)

### Remove Node 16 support[#](#remove-node-16-support "Permanent link")

n8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.

## Updating to n8n 1.0[#](#updating-to-n8n-10 "Permanent link")

1. Create a full backup of n8n.
2. n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.
3. Carefully read the [Deprecations](#deprecations) and [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.
4. Update to n8n 1.0:
   * During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the `next` Docker image.
   * After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the `latest` Docker image.
5. If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.

## Reporting issues[#](#reporting-issues "Permanent link")

If you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community [forum](https://community.n8n.io/).

## Thank you[#](#thank-you "Permanent link")

We would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of our users for their continued support and feedback. Your contributions are invaluable in helping us make n8n the best possible automation tool. We're excited to continue working with you as we move forward with the release of version 1.0 and beyond.

# External secrets | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/





[Skip to content](#external-secrets)







# External secrets[#](#external-secrets "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
* n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault.
* n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

You can use an external secrets store to manage credentials for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](/source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store[#](#connect-n8n-to-your-secrets-store "Permanent link")

Secret names

Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores.

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **External Secrets**.
2. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.
3. Enter the credentials for your provider:
   
   * Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name**, **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.
   * AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID**, **secret access key**, and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue`, and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.
     
     To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:
     
     | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` { 	"Version": "2012-10-17", 	"Statement": [ 		{ 			"Sid": "AccessAllSecrets", 			"Effect": "Allow", 			"Action": [ 				"secretsmanager:ListSecrets", 				"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue", 				"secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy", 				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", 				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret", 				"secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds", 			], 			"Resource": "*" 		} 	] }  ``` |
     | --- | --- |
     
     You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.
     
     Next, you need set the scope for the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.
     
     For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with `n8n` in your specified AWS account and region:
     
     | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ``` | ``` { 	"Version": "2012-10-17", 	"Statement": [ 		{ 			"Sid": "ListingSecrets", 			"Effect": "Allow", 			"Action": [ 				"secretsmanager:ListSecrets", 				"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue" 			], 			"Resource": "*" 		}, 		{ 			"Sid": "RetrievingSecrets", 			"Effect": "Allow", 			"Action": [ 				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", 				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret" 			], 			"Resource": [ 				"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789000:secret:n8n*" 			] 		} 	] }  ``` |
     | --- | --- |
     
     For more IAM permission policy examples, consult the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html#auth-and-access_examples_batch).
   * HashiCorp Vault: provide the **Vault URL** for your vault instance, and select your **Authentication Method**. Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.
     
     + Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method:
       [Token auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token)  
       
       [AppRole auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle)  
       
       [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass)
     + If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to [Vault Enterprise namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.
   * Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token) documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.
     
     Infisical environment
     
     Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.
     
     
     Infisical folders
     
     n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder).
   * Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for more information.
4. **Save** your configuration.
5. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.

## Use secrets in n8n credentials[#](#use-secrets-in-n8n-credentials "Permanent link")

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.
2. On the field where you want to use a secret:
   1. Hover over the field.
   2. Select **Expression**.
3. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an expression referencing the secret name:
   
   | ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}  ``` |
   | --- | --- |
   
   
   `<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments[#](#using-external-secrets-with-n8n-environments "Permanent link")

n8n's [Source control and environments](/source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects[#](#using-external-secrets-in-projects "Permanent link")

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](/user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](/user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

### Infisical version changes[#](#infisical-version-changes "Permanent link")

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin[#](#only-set-external-secrets-on-credentials-owned-by-an-instance-owner-or-admin "Permanent link")

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production.

# Node types | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/





[Skip to content](#built-in-integrations)







# Built-in integrations[#](#built-in-integrations "Permanent link")

This section contains the node library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions[#](#node-operations-triggers-and-actions "Permanent link")

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

* Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](/_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
* Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Core nodes[#](#core-nodes "Permanent link")

Core nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

## Cluster nodes[#](#cluster-nodes "Permanent link")

Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)

## Credentials[#](#credentials "Permanent link")

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](/credentials/).

## Community nodes[#](#community-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), refer to [Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) for more information.

# Manage variables | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/





[Skip to content](#manage-variables)







# Manage variables[#](#manage-variables "Permanent link")

n8n doesn't sync variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials manually when setting up a new instance. You can choose to set up variables manually, or [using the API](#manage-variables-using-the-api).

## Manage variables using the API[#](#manage-variables-using-the-api "Permanent link")

n8n syncs variable names, but doesn't push variable values to your Git provider. You can either:

* Manually set variable values in n8n.
* Set variable values using the n8n API, using the `/pull` endpoint.

Managing variables using the API has several advantages:

* You can automatically update variable values using a CI (continuous integration) tool.
* You may also be able to protect the values.

For example, you can store values in [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), then populate the variables in n8n using an API call from a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

To manage variables using an API call, make a `POST` request to `/source-control/pull`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` 	curl --location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \ 	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \ 	--data '{ 	"force": true, 	"variables": {  			"key1": "value1", 			"key2": "value2" 	} 	} 	'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

If the key already exists in n8n, the API call updates the value. If there is no variable with the key, it creates a new variable.

After setting values using the API, you can safely edit variables in n8n, and push and pull changes.

# Copy work between environments | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/





[Skip to content](#copy-work-between-environments)







# Copy work between environments[#](#copy-work-between-environments "Permanent link")

The steps to send work from one n8n instance to another are different depending on whether you use a single Git branch or multiple branches.

## Single branch[#](#single-branch "Permanent link")

If you have a single Git branch the steps to copy work are:

1. Push work from one instance to the Git branch.
2. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Multiple branches[#](#multiple-branches "Permanent link")

If you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n.

A common pattern is:

1. Do work in your developments instance.
2. Push the work to the development branch in Git.
3. Merge your development branch into your production branch. Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:
   * [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   * [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
   * [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
4. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Automatically send changes to n8n[#](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n "Permanent link")

You can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` curl --request POST \ 	--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \ 	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \ 	--data '{"force": true}'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

This means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.

A GitHub Action example:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` name: CI on:   # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch   push:     branches: [ "production" ]   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab   workflow_dispatch: jobs:   run-pull:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: PULL 				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information         run: >           curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header           'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'  ``` |

# Set up source control | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/setup/





[Skip to content](#set-up-source-control-for-environments)







# Set up source control for environments[#](#set-up-source-control-for-environments "Permanent link")

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/) for more information.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository that allows SSH access.

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches[#](#step-1-set-up-your-repository-and-branches "Permanent link")

For a new setup:

1. Create a new repository for use with n8n.
2. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.

To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n[#](#step-2-configure-git-in-n8n "Permanent link")

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.
3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.
4. Copy the SSH key.

## Step 3: Set up a deploy key[#](#step-3-set-up-a-deploy-key "Permanent link")

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access.

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

* [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)
* [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)

## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance[#](#step-4-connect-n8n-and-configure-your-instance "Permanent link")

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
2. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
3. **Optional**: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
4. **Optional**: choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
5. Select **Save settings**.

# Environments in n8n | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/environments/

# Environments in n8n[#](#environments-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:

* The purpose of environments.
* How environments work in n8n.

## Environments: What and why[#](#environments-what-and-why "Permanent link")

In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).

Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.

There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:

* Development: do work and make changes.
* Production: the live environment.

A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.

## Environments in n8n[#](#environments-in-n8n_1 "Permanent link")

In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:

* The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.
* The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed) and [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/).

How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:

* Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.
* Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.

For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/).

Refer to [Set up source control](/source-control-environments/setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](/source-control-environments/create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations.

### New features[#](#new-features "Permanent link")

Notable new features.

#### Resource mapper UI component[#](#resource-mapper-ui-component "Permanent link")

This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Refer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.1...n8n@0.187.0) for this version.  

**Release date:** 2022-07-20

This release includes several major new features, including:

* The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
* Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.

### New features[#](#new-features_41 "Permanent link")

#### Community nodes repository[#](#community-nodes-repository "Permanent link")

This release introduces the [community node repository](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.


#### Data pinning[#](#data-pinning "Permanent link")

[Data pinning](/data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.


#### Data mapping[#](#data-mapping "Permanent link")

This release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](/data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.


#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators[#](#simplify-authentication-setup-for-node-creators "Permanent link")

This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.
n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `"generic"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.

You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.

For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ``` | ``` // in AsanaApi.credentials.ts import { 	IAuthenticateGeneric, 	ICredentialType, 	INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType { 	name = 'asanaApi'; 	displayName = 'Asana API'; 	documentationUrl = 'asana'; 	properties: INodeProperties[] = [ 		{ 			displayName: 'Access Token', 			name: 'accessToken', 			type: 'string', 			default: '', 		}, 	];  	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { 		type: 'generic', 		properties: { 			headers: { 				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}', 			}, 		}, 	}; }  ``` |

**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.

The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.

### New features[#](#new-features_48 "Permanent link")

#### Credential reuse for custom API operations[#](#credential-reuse-for-custom-api-operations "Permanent link")

n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

For more information, refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/).

#### Node details view[#](#node-details-view "Permanent link")

An improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.

### Node enhancements[#](#node-enhancements_39 "Permanent link")

**Release date:** 2022-05-02

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.

### New features[#](#new-features_50 "Permanent link")

#### Node versioning[#](#node-versioning "Permanent link")

0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays).

### Overhauled Code node editing experience[#](#overhauled-code-node-editing-experience "Permanent link")

We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:

* TypeScript autocomplete
* TypeScript linting
* TypeScript hover tips
* Search and replace
* New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap
* Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)
* Remember folded regions and history after refresh
* Multi cursor
* Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types
* Drag and drop for all Code node modes
* Indentation markers

We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing.   

  

To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. üëá

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/De1E58MPaMQ?t=645)



### New node: Microsoft Entra ID[#](#new-node-microsoft-entra-id "Permanent link")

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is used for cloud-based identity and access management. [The new node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra/) supports a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups.

### Node updates[#](#node-updates "Permanent link")

* [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Vector stores can now be directly used as tools for the agent
* [Code](/code/builtin/overview/): Tons of new speed and convenience features, see above for details
* [Google Vertex Chat](/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglevertex/): Added option to specify the GCP region for the Google API credentials
* [HighLevel](/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.highlevel/): Added support for calendar items

We also added a custom [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/) icon selector on top of the available emojis. Pretty!

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta[#](#task-runners-for-the-code-node-in-public-beta "Permanent link")

We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

![Task runners overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)

Task runners overview


Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

* Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes
* External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](/hosting/configuration/task-runners/).

### Node updates[#](#node-updates_3 "Permanent link")

* [AI Transform node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data
* [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped

This release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

### New node: n8n Form[#](#new-node-n8n-form "Permanent link")

Use the [n8n Form node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

![A multi-page form with branching](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/example_image.png)

A multi-page form with branching


Additionally you can:

* Set default selections with query parameters
* Define the form with a JSON array of objects
* Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL
### Node updates[#](#node-updates_6 "Permanent link")

New nodes:

* [Google Business Profile](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows

Enhanced nodes:

* [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool
* [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation
* [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates[#](#enhanced-node-remove-duplicates "Permanent link")

The [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:

* Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates
* Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.

### New node: Gong[#](#new-node-gong "Permanent link")

The new node for [Gong](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

**Release date:** 2024-10-09

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

What changed?

* The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.
* The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.

When is action necessary?

* If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.
* If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

### Node updates[#](#node-updates_7 "Permanent link")

* [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID
* [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow

We have also optimized the [worker health checks](/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above).

Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

## n8n@1.62.1[#](#n8n1621 "Permanent link")

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.61.0...n8n@1.62.1) for this version.  

**Release date:** 2024-10-02

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

Skipped 1.62.0

We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.


#### Additional nodes as tools[#](#additional-nodes-as-tools "Permanent link")

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).
  
  


  
  

Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.
  
  

Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.

### Node updates[#](#node-updates_8 "Permanent link")

* [Google BigQuery](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): Added credential support for Sysdig
* [Invoice Ninja](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.invoiceninja/): Additional query params for getAll requests
* [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): Added the option to use a custom prompt

Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.

Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

Breaking change

Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470) for details.

This release contains bug fixes, feature enhancements, a new node, node enhancements and performance improvements.

Backup recommended

Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.


Credential sharing required for manual executions

Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](/credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.


#### New feature: Projects[#](#new-feature-projects "Permanent link")

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.
  
  

Refer to the [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.
  
  

The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.



#### New node: Slack Trigger[#](#new-node-slack-trigger "Permanent link")

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

### Other highlights[#](#other-highlights "Permanent link")

* Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/#using-memory-with-openai-assistants).

### Rolling back to a previous version[#](#rolling-back-to-a-previous-version "Permanent link")

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
2. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

Breaking change

Please note that this version contains a breaking change for instances using a Postgres database. The default value for the DB\_POSTGRESDB\_USER environment variable was switched from `root` to `postgres`. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1400) for details.

This release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node[#](#new-feature-ask-ai-in-the-http-node "Permanent link")

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
2. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
3. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/ai/)


#### New node: Groq Chat Model[#](#new-node-groq-chat-model "Permanent link")

This release adds the [Groq Chat Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq/).

Breaking change

Please note that this version contains a breaking change for self-hosted n8n. It removes the `--file` flag for the `execute` CLI command. If you have scripts relying on the `--file` flag, update them to first import the workflow and then execute it using the `--id` flag. Refer to [CLI commands](/hosting/cli-commands/) for more information on CLI options.

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files[#](#new-nodes-and-improved-experience-for-working-with-files "Permanent link")

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

* [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
* [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
* [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).


#### New node: Qdrant vector store[#](#new-node-qdrant-vector-store "Permanent link")

# Tutorial - Create environments with source control | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/





[Skip to content](#tutorial-create-environments-with-source-control)







# Tutorial: Create environments with source control[#](#tutorial-create-environments-with-source-control "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Available on Enterprise.
* You need to be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to set up source control, and to send work to and from Git.

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:

* [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.
* [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.

## Choose your source control pattern[#](#choose-your-source-control-pattern "Permanent link")

Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

### Multiple instances, multiple branches[#](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches "Permanent link")

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

The advantages of this pattern are:

* An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
* It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

### Multiple instances, one branch[#](#multiple-instances-one-branch "Permanent link")

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

* If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](/source-control-environments/create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
* Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## Set up your repository[#](#set-up-your-repository "Permanent link")

Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.

Multi-branchSingle-branch

1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
   * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
   * Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.
2. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.

[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

* Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
* Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.


## Connect your n8n instances to your repository[#](#connect-your-n8n-instances-to-your-repository "Permanent link")

Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.

### Configure Git in n8n[#](#configure-git-in-n8n "Permanent link")

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.
3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.
4. Copy the SSH key.

### Set up a deploy key[#](#set-up-a-deploy-key "Permanent link")

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) for guidance.

### Connect n8n and configure your instance[#](#connect-n8n-and-configure-your-instance "Permanent link")

Multi-branchSingle-branch

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
2. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.
3. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
4. Select **Save settings**.

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.
2. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.
3. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
4. Select **Save settings**.


## Push work from development[#](#push-work-from-development "Permanent link")

In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.

To push work to Git:

1. Select **Push** ![Push icon](/_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.
   
   View screenshot
   
   
   ![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png)

   ![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png)
   
   Pull and push buttons when menu is open
2. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.
3. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
4. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## Pull work to production[#](#pull-work-to-production "Permanent link")

Your work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.

Multi-branchSingle-branch

1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.
2. Merge the pull request.
3. In your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

In your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls[#](#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls "Permanent link")

If you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and the [n8n API](/api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.

A GitHub Action example:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` name: CI on:   # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch   push:     branches: [ "production" ]   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab   workflow_dispatch: jobs:   run-pull:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: PULL 				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information         run: >           curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header           'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'  ``` |

# Push and pull | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/





[Skip to content](#push-and-pull)







# Push and pull[#](#push-and-pull "Permanent link")

If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git.

This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Fetch other people's work[#](#fetch-other-peoples-work "Permanent link")

Restricted feature

Ordinary users can't fetch work from Git. You must be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to fetch work from Git.

To pull work from Git, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

View screenshot


![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png)

Pull and push buttons when menu is open




n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.

When the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them.

How deleted resources are handled

When workflows, credentials, variables, and tags are deleted from the repository, your local versions of these resources aren't deleted automatically. Instead, when you pull repository changes, n8n notifies you about any outdated resources and asks if you'd like to delete them.

### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull[#](#workflow-and-credential-owner-may-change-on-pull "Permanent link")

When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.

If the original owner is a user:

If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.

If the original owner is a [project](/user-management/rbac/):

n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.

### Pulling may cause brief service interruption[#](#pulling-may-cause-brief-service-interruption "Permanent link")

If you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.

## Send your work to Git[#](#send-your-work-to-git "Permanent link")

Restricted feature

Ordinary users can't send work to Git. You must be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to send work to Git.

To push work to Git:

1. Select **Push** ![Push icon](/_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.
   
   View screenshot
   
   
   ![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png)

   ![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png)
   
   Pull and push buttons when menu is open
2. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.
3. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
4. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## What gets committed[#](#what-gets-committed "Permanent link")

n8n commits the following to Git:

* Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.
* Credential stubs (ID, name, type)
* Variable stubs (ID and name)
* Projects

You can programmatically [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) using the n8n API.

## Merge behaviors and conflicts[#](#merge-behaviors-and-conflicts "Permanent link")

n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.

### Workflows[#](#workflows "Permanent link")

You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.

When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.

When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.

To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.

To avoid losing data:

* Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.
* Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.
* Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.

### Credentials, variables and workflow tags[#](#credentials-variables-and-workflow-tags "Permanent link")

Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.

On pull:

* If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.
* If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:
  + You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.
  + The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.
  + The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.

On push:

* n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
* If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

Manage credentials with an external secrets vault

If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [external secrets](/external-secrets/).

# Branch patterns | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/





[Skip to content](#branch-patterns)







# Branch patterns[#](#branch-patterns "Permanent link")

The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Multiple instances, multiple branches[#](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches "Permanent link")

This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.

The advantages of this pattern are:

* An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
* It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

## Multiple instances, one branch[#](#multiple-instances-one-branch "Permanent link")

Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.

This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

* If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](/source-control-environments/create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
* Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

## One instance, multiple branches[#](#one-instance-multiple-branches "Permanent link")

The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.

This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.

No cleanup

n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)

## One instance, one branch[#](#one-instance-one-branch "Permanent link")

This is the simplest pattern.

# Git and n8n | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/git/





[Skip to content](#git-and-n8n)







# Git and n8n[#](#git-and-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.

New to Git and source control?

If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.


Familiar with Git and source control?

If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.

This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](/source-control-environments/setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.

This is a brief introduction

Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).

## Git overview[#](#git-overview "Permanent link")

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Branches: Multiple copies of a project[#](#branches-multiple-copies-of-a-project "Permanent link")

Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/simple-git-branch.png)

## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider[#](#local-and-remote-moving-work-between-your-machine-and-a-git-provider "Permanent link")

A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.

n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.

## Push, pull, and commit[#](#push-pull-and-commit "Permanent link")

n8n uses three key Git processes:

* **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.
* **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.
  
  Pulling overwrites your work
  
  If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.
* **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.

Refer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git.

# Item Lists | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.itemlists/





[Skip to content](#item-lists)







# Item Lists[#](#item-lists "Permanent link")

Removed in 1.21.0

n8n removed the Item Lists node in version 1.21.0. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
* [Summarize](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

The Item Lists node simplifies working with returned data that contain lists (arrays), enabling you to change the structure for further processing without the need to use [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) nodes or write custom JavaScript.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

The Item Lists node enables you to perform the following operations:

* Concatenate Items: merge multiple items into a single new item.
* Limit: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* Remove Duplicates: remove extraneous items.
* Sort: change the ordering of items.
* Split Out Items: create separate items from a list of data within an item.
* Summarize: aggregate items together. Similar to a pivot table.

### Split Out Items[#](#split-out-items "Permanent link")

This operation is useful if your data contains a list of items, for example a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

When using the Split Out Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Field to Split Out**: the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.
  + If working with file inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.
* **Include**: select if you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item. You can select:
  + **No Other Fields**
  + **All Other Fields**
  + **Selected Other Fields**: when selected, n8n displays **Fields to Include**. Enter a comma separated list of desired fields.
  + **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
    - **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).
    - **Destination Field Name**: optionally set the field name under which to put the new split contents.
    - **Include Binary**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.

### Concatenate Items[#](#concatenate-items "Permanent link")

The Concatenate Items operations is useful when you want to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

When using the Concatenate Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Aggregate**: choose whether to aggregate **Individual Fields** or **All Item Data**.
* If you choose **Individual Fields**, you can then set:
  + **Field To Aggregate**: the name of the field in the input data to be aggregated together.
  + **Rename Field**: enable this toggle to enter a field name for the aggregated output data. When aggregating multiple fields you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
  + **Output Field Name**: displayed when you enable **Rename Field**. The field name for the aggregated output data.
  + **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
    - **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).
    - **Include Binaries**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.
* If you choose **All Item Data**, you can then set:
  + **Put Output in Field**: the name of the output field.
  + **Include**: choose from **All fields**, **Specified Fields**, or **All Fields Except**.

### Remove Duplicates[#](#remove-duplicates "Permanent link")

There are situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

The Remove Duplicates operation allows you to identify those items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.

When using the Remove Duplicates operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Compare**: specify which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
* **All Fields**: compares all fields of the input data.
* **All Fields Except**: enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
* **Selected Fields**: enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
* If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields**, n8n displays **Options** > **Add Field**. Use this to add more optional settings, including:
  + **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).

### Sort[#](#sort "Permanent link")

The Sort operation allows you to organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

Array sort behavior

The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to learn more.

When using the Sort operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Type**: use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting. The following options are available:
* **Simple**: when you selected, you can use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the fields, and select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.
* **Random**: select to create a random order in the list.
* **Code**: when selected, displays a code input field where you can enter custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation.
* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
  + **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).

### Limit[#](#limit "Permanent link")

If you want to keep and process a specific number of items from your incoming data, the Limit operation allows you to select the number of items to keep and whether n8n should take them from the beginning or end of the data.

When using the Limit operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Max Items**: enter the maximum number of items that n8n should keep. If the input data contains more than this value, n8n removes the items.
* **Keep**: when items must be removed, select if n8n keeps the input items at the beginning or end.

### Summarize[#](#summarize "Permanent link")

Aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

When using the Summarize operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Fields to Summarize**:
  + To combine values, select an **Aggregation** method, and enter a **Field** name.
  + To split values, enter a field name or list of names in **Fields to Split By**.
* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
  + **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).
  + **Each Split in a Separate Item**: splitting generates a separate output item for each split out field.
  + **All Splits in a Single Item**: splitting generates a single item, which lists the split out fields.

# Concurrency | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/





[Skip to content](#cloud-concurrency)







# Cloud concurrency[#](#cloud-concurrency "Permanent link")

Only for n8n Cloud

This document discusses concurrency in n8n Cloud. Read [self-hosted n8n concurrency control](/hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/) to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances.

Too many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.

Any executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

## Concurrency limits[#](#concurrency-limits "Permanent link")

n8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan:

* Starter and Trial: 5
* Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20
* Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50
* Enterprise (in regular mode): 200

You can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Details[#](#details "Permanent link")

Some other details about concurrency to keep in mind:

* Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.
* Test evaluations do not count towards concurrency limits. Your test evaluation concurrency limit is equal to, but separate from, your plan's regular concurrency limit.
* You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
* On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

## Comparison to queue mode[#](#comparison-to-queue-mode "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Queue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

Concurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance.

[Skip to content](#change-instance-ownership)







# Change ownership or username

## Change instance ownership[#](#change-instance-ownership "Permanent link")

You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the **Settings** page in the owner's account and editing the **Email** field. After making the changes, scroll down and press **Save**.
Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address can't be linked to any other n8n account.

Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.

If the workspace is deactivated, there will be no **Settings** page and no possibility to change the email address or the owner info.

## Change instance username[#](#change-instance-username "Permanent link")

It's not currently possible to change usernames.

If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [The import/export documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/) explains how you can transfer your work to a new n8n instance.

# Cloud data management | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/





[Skip to content](#cloud-data-management)







# Cloud data management[#](#cloud-data-management "Permanent link")

There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:

* Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.
* Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data

## Memory limits on each Cloud plan[#](#memory-limits-on-each-cloud-plan "Permanent link")

Current plans:

* Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
* Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
* Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

Legacy plans:

* Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.

## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow[#](#how-to-reduce-memory-consumption-in-your-workflow "Permanent link")

The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.

* Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
* Avoid using the Code node where possible.
* Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
* Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.

Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.

## How to manage execution data on Cloud[#](#how-to-manage-execution-data-on-cloud "Permanent link")

Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.

Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.

If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.

There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:

In the admin dashboard:

1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.
2. Select **Manage**.
3. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.

In your workflow settings:

1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.
2. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
3. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.

n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:

* Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;
* Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;
* Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.

### Manual data pruning[#](#manual-data-pruning "Permanent link")

Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.

1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.
2. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.

Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up.

# n8n Glossary | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/









# Glossary

* **AI agent**: AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.
* **AI chains**: AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).
* **AI embedding**: Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.
* **AI memory**: In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.
* **AI tools**: In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.
* **AI vector store**: Vector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.
* **API**: APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.
* **canvas (n8n)**: The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.
* **cluster nodes (n8n)**: In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.
* **credential (n8n)**: In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.
* **data pinning (n8n)**: Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.
* **editor (n8n)**: The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.
* **evaluation (n8n)**: In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.
* **expression (n8n)**: In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.
* **LangChain**: LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.
* **Large language models (LLMs)**: Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.
* **node (n8n)**: In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.
* **project (n8n)**: n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.
* **root node (n8n)**: Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.
* **sub node (n8n)**: n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.
* **template (n8n)**: n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.
* **trigger node (n8n)**: A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.
* **workflow (n8n)**: An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.

# Binary data | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/





[Skip to content](#binary-data)







# Binary data[#](#binary-data "Permanent link")

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.

This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.

## Working with binary data in your workflows[#](#working-with-binary-data-in-your-workflows "Permanent link")

You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.

### Nodes[#](#nodes "Permanent link")

There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

* [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
* [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
* [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:

* [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/)
* [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/)

And nodes for performing common tasks:

* [Compression](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.compression/)
* [Edit Image](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/)
* [FTP](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ftp/)

You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the [Local File trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).

To split or concatenate binary data items, use the [data transformation nodes](/data/#data-transformation-nodes).

### Code[#](#code "Permanent link")

You can use the [Code node](/code/code-node/) to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example, [Get the binary data buffer](/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/): get the binary data available in your workflow.

## Configure binary data mode when self-hosting[#](#configure-binary-data-mode-when-self-hosting "Permanent link")

You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the [Binary data environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data). This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.

Your configuration affects how well n8n scales: [Scaling | Binary data filesystem mode](/hosting/scaling/binary-data/).

Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.

# Item linking for node creators | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/





[Skip to content](#item-linking-for-node-creators)







# Item linking for node creators[#](#item-linking-for-node-creators "Permanent link")

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { 	"json": { . . . }, 	"pairedItem": { 		"item": item.pairedItem, 		// Optional: choose the input to use 		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs 		"input": 0 };  // Or set the index manually newItem = { 		"json": { . . . } 		"pairedItem": { 			"item": i, 			// Optional: choose the input to use 			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs 			"input": 0 		}, };  ``` |

# Item linking in the Code node | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/





[Skip to content](#item-linking-in-the-code-node)







# Item linking in the Code node[#](#item-linking-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts). This document focuses on practical usage examples.

When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$("<node-name>").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.

These scenarios are when you:

* Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
* Return new items.
* Want to manually control the item linking.

[n8n's automatic item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.

To control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"json": { 			. . .  		}, 		// The index of the input item that generated this output item 		"pairedItem": 0 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### `pairedItem` usage example[#](#paireditem-usage-example "Permanent link")

Take this input data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` [   {     "id": "23423532",     "name": "Jay Gatsby"   },   {     "id": "23423533",     "name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a"   },   {     "id": "23423534",     "name": "Max Sendak"   },   {     "id": "23423535",     "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox"   },   {     "id": "23423536",     "name": "Edmund Pevensie"   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){   newItems.push(     {     "json":       {         "name": items[i].json.name, 				"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i       }     }   ) }  return newItems;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.

Add the `pairedItem` object:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){   newItems.push(     {       "json":         {           "name": items[i].json.name, 					"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i         },       "pairedItem": i     }       ) } return newItems;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Each new item now links to the item used to create it.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/





[Skip to content](#data-item-linking)







# Data item linking[#](#data-item-linking "Permanent link")

An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items.

You need to understand this behavior if you're:

* Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
* Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.
* Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.

This section provides:

* A conceptual overview of [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/).
* Information on [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/).
* Support for end users who need to [Work with the data path](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/) to retrieve item data from previous nodes, and link items when using the Code node.
* Guidance on troubleshooting [Errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

# Data mapping in the expressions editor | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-expressions/





[Skip to content](#mapping-in-the-expressions-editor)







# Mapping in the expressions editor[#](#mapping-in-the-expressions-editor "Permanent link")

These examples show how to access linked items in the expressions editor. Refer to [expressions](/code/expressions/) for more information on expressions, including built in variables and methods.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## Access the linked item in a previous node's output[#](#access-the-linked-item-in-a-previous-nodes-output "Permanent link")

When you use this, n8n works back up the item linking chain, to find the parent item in the given node.

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // Returns the linked item {{$("<node-name>").item}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

As a longer example, consider a scenario where a node earlier in the workflow has the following output data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` [   {     "id": "23423532",     "name": "Jay Gatsby",   },   {     "id": "23423533",     "name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a",   },   {     "id": "23423534",     "name": "Max Sendak",   },   {     "id": "23423535",     "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",   },   {     "id": "23423536",     "name": "Edmund Pevensie",   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To extract the name, use the following expression:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$("<node-name>").item.json.name}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Access the linked item in the current node's input[#](#access-the-linked-item-in-the-current-nodes-input "Permanent link")

In this case, the item linking is within the node: find the input item that the node links to an output item.

| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // Returns the linked item {{$input.item}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

As a longer example, consider a scenario where the current node has the following input data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` [   {     "id": "23423532",     "name": "Jay Gatsby",   },   {     "id": "23423533",     "name": "Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a",   },   {     "id": "23423534",     "name": "Max Sendak",   },   {     "id": "23423535",     "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",   },   {     "id": "23423536",     "name": "Edmund Pevensie",   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

To extract the name, you'd normally use drag-and-drop [Data mapping](/data/data-mapping/), but you could also write the following expression:

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$input.item.json.name}}  ``` |

# Data flow within nodes[#](#data-flow-within-nodes "Permanent link")

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		name-input-value: "test1" 	}, 	{ 		name-input-value: "test2" 	} ]  ``` |

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		// For most data: 		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json' 		"json": { 			// Example data 			"apple": "beets", 			"carrot": { 				"dill": 1 			} 		}, 		// For binary data: 		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary' 		"binary": { 			// Example data 			"apple-picture": { 				"data": "....", // Base64 encoded binary data (required) 				"mimeType": "image/png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) 				"fileExtension": "png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) 				"fileName": "example.png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) 			} 		} 	}, ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |


Skipping the `json` key and array syntax

From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array (`[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.

## Data item processing[#](#data-item-processing "Permanent link")

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		name-input-value: "test1" 	}, 	{ 		name-input-value: "test2" 	} ]  ``` |

[Skip to content](#data)







# Data[#](#data "Permanent link")

Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:

* Create your own node
* Write custom expressions
* Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/)
* [Data flow within nodes](/data/data-flow-nodes/)
* [Transforming data](/data/transforming-data/)
* [Process data using code](/data/code/)
* [Pinning](/data/data-pinning/) and [editing](/data/data-editing/) data during workflow development.
* [Data mapping](/data/data-mapping/) and [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): how data items link to each other.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

### Data transformation nodes[#](#data-transformation-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
* [Summarize](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Data mocking | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/





[Skip to content](#data-mocking)







# Data mocking[#](#data-mocking "Permanent link")

Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:

* Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
* Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
* Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.

## Mocking with real data using data pinning[#](#mocking-with-real-data-using-data-pinning "Permanent link")

Using [data pinning](/data/data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](/data/data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** ![Pin data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png). When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes[#](#generate-custom-data-using-the-code-or-edit-fields-nodes "Permanent link")

You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) or the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/).

In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add fields** to add your custom data.

The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.

## Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node[#](#output-a-sample-data-set-from-the-customer-datastore-node "Permanent link")

The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.

Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with.

# Data pinning | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/





[Skip to content](#data-pinning)







# Data pinning[#](#data-pinning "Permanent link")

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

* If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
* If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
* You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).

For development only

Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Pin data[#](#pin-data "Permanent link")

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** ![Pin data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png). When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Unpin data[#](#unpin-data "Permanent link")

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner.

# Item linking errors | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/





[Skip to content](#item-linking-errors)







# Item linking errors[#](#item-linking-errors "Permanent link")

In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.

![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)



Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.




Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.

`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.

When using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:

* The thread is broken
* The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)

To solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.

You can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you‚Äôre targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.

The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.

### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'[#](#fix-for-info-for-expressions-missing-from-previous-node "Permanent link")

If you see this error message:

> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node

There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:

* Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/) for more information.
* Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/) for more information.

### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'[#](#fix-for-multiple-matching-items-for-expression "Permanent link")

This is the error message:

> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression

Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.

When you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:

* Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.
* Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.

# Item linking concepts | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/





[Skip to content](#item-linking-concepts)







# Item linking concepts[#](#item-linking-concepts "Permanent link")

Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.

This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:

* [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
* [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.

## n8n's automatic item linking[#](#n8ns-automatic-item-linking "Permanent link")

If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:

* Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
* Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
* Multiple inputs and outputs:
  + If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
  + If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
  + If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.

If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/) for more information.

## Item linking example[#](#item-linking-example "Permanent link")

![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.

The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:

* [Mapping in the UI](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/)
* [Mapping in the expressions editor](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-expressions/)
* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/)

# Data mapping in the UI | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/





[Skip to content](#mapping-in-the-ui)







# Mapping in the UI[#](#mapping-in-the-ui "Permanent link")

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

* Using the expressions editor.
* By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## How to drag and drop data[#](#how-to-drag-and-drop-data "Permanent link")

1. Run your workflow to load data.
2. Open the node where you need to map data.
3. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
   * In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
   * In JSON view: click and hold a key.
   * In schema view: click and hold a key.
4. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.

### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop[#](#understand-what-youre-mapping-with-drag-and-drop "Permanent link")

Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"fruit": "apples", 		"color": "green" 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.

### Understand nested data[#](#understand-nested-data "Permanent link")

Given the following data:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` [   {     "name": "First item",     "nested": {       "example-number-field": 1,       "example-string-field": "apples"     }   },   {     "name": "Second item",     "nested": {       "example-number-field": 2,       "example-string-field": "oranges"     }   } ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

n8n displays it in table form like this:

!["Screenshot of a table in the INPUT panel. It includes a top level field named "nested." This field contains nested data, which is indicated in bold."](/_images/data/data-mapping/nested-data.png)

# Transforming data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/data/transforming-data/





[Skip to content](#transforming-data)







# Transforming data[#](#transforming-data "Permanent link")

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](/data/data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

![HTTP Request node output](/_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
* [Summarize](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

[Skip to content](#execution-order-in-multi-branch-workflows)







# Execution order in multi-branch workflows[#](#execution-order-in-multi-branch-workflows "Permanent link")

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

* For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
* For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).

# Error handling | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/





[Skip to content](#error-handling)







# Error handling[#](#error-handling "Permanent link")

When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.

Investigating errors

To investigate failed executions, you can:

* Review your [Executions](/workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](/workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](/workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.
* Enable [Log streaming](/log-streaming/).
## Create and set an error workflow[#](#create-and-set-an-error-workflow "Permanent link")

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
2. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
3. Select **Save**.
4. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.
   2. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   3. Select **Save**.
      Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

## Error data[#](#error-data "Permanent link")

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` [ 	{ 		"execution": { 			"id": "231", 			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231", 			"retryOf": "34", 			"error": { 				"message": "Example Error Message", 				"stack": "Stacktrace" 			}, 			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error", 			"mode": "manual" 		}, 		"workflow": { 			"id": "1", 			"name": "Example Workflow" 		} 	} ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

All information is always present, except:

* `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
* `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
* `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` {   "trigger": {     "error": {       "context": {},       "name": "WorkflowActivationError",       "cause": {         "message": "",         "stack": ""       },       "timestamp": 1654609328787,       "message": "",       "node": {         . . .        }     },     "mode": "trigger"   },   "workflow": {     "id": "",     "name": ""   } }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error[#](#cause-a-workflow-execution-failure-using-stop-and-error "Permanent link")

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/





[Skip to content](#sub-workflows)







# Sub-workflows[#](#sub-workflows "Permanent link")

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](/hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow[#](#set-up-and-use-a-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow[#](#create-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Create a new workflow.
   
   Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
   
   You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.
2. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
   
   1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
   * **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide.
   * **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   * **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
6. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.


Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
3. In the sub-workflow [settings](/workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/).
6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow[#](#call-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
   
   Find your workflow ID
   
   Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows[#](#how-data-passes-between-workflows "Permanent link")

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

# Waiting | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/waiting/





[Skip to content](#waiting)







# Waiting[#](#waiting "Permanent link")

Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.

Making a workflow wait uses the [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.

n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of [Rate limiting and waiting for external events](https://n8n.io/workflows/1749-rate-limiting-and-waiting-for-external-events/).

[Skip to content](#two-factor-authentication-2fa)







# Two-factor authentication (2FA)[#](#two-factor-authentication-2fa "Permanent link")

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.

## Enable 2FA[#](#enable-2fa "Permanent link")

You need an authenticator app on your phone.

To enable 2FA in n8n:

1. Go to you **Settings** > **Personal**.
2. Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
3. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
4. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.
5. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.
6. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.

## Disable 2FA for your instance[#](#disable-2fa-for-your-instance "Permanent link")

Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.

[Skip to content](#best-practices-for-user-management)







# Best practices for user management[#](#best-practices-for-user-management "Permanent link")

This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

## All platforms[#](#all-platforms "Permanent link")

* n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
* Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
* To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
* Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
  + The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
  + Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

## Self-hosted[#](#self-hosted "Permanent link")

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

* `N8N_HOST`
* `N8N_PORT`
* `N8N_PROTOCOL`
* `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

# RBAC role types | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/role-types/





[Skip to content](#rbac-role-types)







# RBAC role types[#](#rbac-role-types "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
* The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.

Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.

## Project Admin[#](#project-admin "Permanent link")

A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:

* Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
* Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
* View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Editor[#](#project-editor "Permanent link")

A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Viewer[#](#project-viewer "Permanent link")

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](/user-management/account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/).

| Permission | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View workflows in the project | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View credentials in the project | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View executions | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit credentials and workflows | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Add workflows and credentials | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Execute workflows | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Manage members | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Modify the project | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

[Variables](/code/variables/) and [tags](/workflows/tags/) aren't affected by RBAC: they're global across the n8n instance.

To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.


Account types and role types

Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/).

Every account has one type. The account can have different [role types](/user-management/rbac/role-types/) for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/).


Create a member-level account for the owner

n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

# Looping | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/





[Skip to content](#looping-in-n8n)







# Looping in n8n[#](#looping-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n[#](#using-loops-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

![The Customer Datastore node output](/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
2. Configure the parameters.
3. Execute the node.

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once[#](#executing-nodes-once "Permanent link")

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.

## Creating loops[#](#creating-loops "Permanent link")

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met[#](#loop-until-a-condition-is-met "Permanent link")

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

![Editor UI view of sample workflow](/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)

### Loop until all items are processed[#](#loop-until-all-items-are-processed "Permanent link")

Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

## Node exceptions[#](#node-exceptions "Permanent link")

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

* [CrateDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
* [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
* [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
* [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
* [MongoDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
* [QuestDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
* [Redis](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
  + Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
* [TimescaleDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.

# Merging data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/





[Skip to content](#merging-data)







# Merging data[#](#merging-data "Permanent link")

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

* Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
* Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
* Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams[#](#merge-data-from-different-data-streams "Permanent link")

If your workflow [splits](/flow-logic/splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/)
## Merge data from different nodes[#](#merge-data-from-different-nodes "Permanent link")

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

![Merging data from two previous nodes. The diagram shows three nodes lined up sequentially. The first node is labeled Fetch data, the second is labeled Modify data, and the third is labeled Merge: append both data sets. Arrows connect nodes 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3.](/_images/flow-logic/merging/merge-node-data.png)

Merging data from two previous nodes


## Merge data from multiple node executions[#](#merge-data-from-multiple-node-executions "Permanent link")

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/) scenarios.

Node executions and workflow executions

This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/) using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/)
## Compare, merge, and split again[#](#compare-merge-and-split-again "Permanent link")

The [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/) for an example.

[Skip to content](#splitting-workflows-with-conditional-nodes)







# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes[#](#splitting-workflows-with-conditional-nodes "Permanent link")

Splitting uses the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.

Compare these workflows:

!["Diagram representing two workflows. One has three steps and follows a linear process, with a user submitting a bug, and the workflow emailing a support team. The second workflow starts the same way, but then splits depending on whether the user marked the issue as urgent. It then splits again depending on the user's support plan"](/_images/flow-logic/splitting/single-multi-branch-workflow.png)

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.

Refer to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details.

[Skip to content](#create-and-edit-credentials)







# Create and edit credentials[#](#create-and-edit-credentials "Permanent link")

Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.

## Create a credential[#](#create-a-credential "Permanent link")

1. Select the¬†![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png)¬†**button**¬†in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential.
2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

Or:

1. Using the ![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **Create**¬†button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific project. Select¬†Credential.
2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

Credentials naming

n8n names new credentials "*node name* account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

## Expressions in credentials[#](#expressions-in-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use expressions to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:

1. In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
2. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
3. Toggle **Expression** on.
4. Enter your expression.

### Example workflow[#](#example-workflow "Permanent link")

[View workflow file](/_workflows/credentials/dynamic_credentials_using_expressions.json)
#### Using the example[#](#using-the-example "Permanent link")

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

* Yellow: notes and information.
* Green: instructions to run the workflow.
* Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
* Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)[#](#lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
* You need access to the n8n instance owner account.

This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.

LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.

## Enable LDAP[#](#enable-ldap "Permanent link")

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
2. Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](/_images/common-icons/settings.png) > **LDAP**.
3. Toggle on **Enable LDAP Login**.
4. Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
5. Select **Test connection** to check your connection setup, or **Save connection** to create the connection.

After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the **User Filter** setting.

You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the **Settings** > **Users** page.

## Merging n8n and LDAP accounts[#](#merging-n8n-and-ldap-accounts "Permanent link")

If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.

## LDAP user accounts in n8n[#](#ldap-user-accounts-in-n8n "Permanent link")

On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.

You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.

User deletion

If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.

## Turn LDAP off[#](#turn-ldap-off "Permanent link")

To turn LDAP off:

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
2. Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](/_images/common-icons/settings.png) > **LDAP**.
3. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.

# Settings | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/





[Skip to content](#workflow-settings)







# Workflow settings[#](#workflow-settings "Permanent link")

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
2. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.
3. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.

The following settings are available:

* **Execution order**: choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. **v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. **v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
* **Error Workflow**: select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [Error workflows](/flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.
* **This workflow can be called by**: choose whether other workflow can call this workflow.
* **Timezone**: sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.
* **Save failed production executions**: whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
* **Save successful production executions**: whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
* **Save manual executions**: whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
* **Save execution progress**: whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
* **Timeout Workflow**: toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
  + **Timeout After**: Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.

1. Select the project.
2. Select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Delete project**.
4. Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
   * **Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project**: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
   * **Delete its workflows and credentials**: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.

## Move workflows and credentials between projects or users[#](#move-workflows-and-credentials-between-projects-or-users "Permanent link")

Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.

1. Select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) or **Credential menu** ![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Move**.
2. Select the project or user you want to move to.
3. Select **Next**.
4. Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.
5. Select **Confirm move to new project**.

## Using external secrets in projects[#](#using-external-secrets-in-projects "Permanent link")

[Skip to content](#workflow-sharing)







# Workflow sharing[#](#workflow-sharing "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Available on Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.

Workflow sharing allows you to share workflows between users of the same n8n instance.

Users can share workflows they created. Instance owners, and users with the admin role, can view and share all workflows in the instance. Refer to [Account types](/user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

## Share a workflow[#](#share-a-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Open the workflow you want to share.
2. Select **Share**.
3. In **Add users**, find and select the users you want to share with.
4. Select **Save**.

## View shared workflows[#](#view-shared-workflows "Permanent link")

You can browse and search workflows on the **Workflows** list. The workflows in the list depend on the project:

* **Overview** lists all workflows you can access. This includes:
  + Your own workflows.
  + Workflows shared with you.
  + Workflows in projects you're a member of.
  + If you log in as the instance owner or admin: all workflows in the instance.
* Other projects: all workflows in the project.

## Workflow roles and permissions[#](#workflow-roles-and-permissions "Permanent link")

There are two workflow roles: creator and editor. The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.

You can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.

Credentials

Workflow sharing allows editors to use all credentials used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing/).

### Permissions[#](#permissions "Permanent link")

| Permissions | Creator | Editor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View workflow (read-only) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View executions | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Update (including tags) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Run | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Share | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Export | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Delete | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

## Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials[#](#node-editing-restrictions-with-unshared-credentials "Permanent link")

Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.

Refer to [Credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials.

# Custom executions data | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/





[Skip to content](#custom-executions-data)







# Custom executions data[#](#custom-executions-data "Permanent link")

You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the [Execution Data node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/). n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

* Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
* Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

Available in version 0.222.0 and above.

## Set and access custom data using the Code node[#](#set-and-access-custom-data-using-the-code-node "Permanent link")

This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to [Execution Data node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.

### Set custom executions data[#](#set-custom-executions-data "Permanent link")

Set a single piece of extra data:

JavaScriptPython

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $execution.customData.set("key", "value");  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` _execution.customData.set("key", "value");  ``` |
| --- | --- |




Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:

JavaScriptPython

| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})  ``` |
| --- | --- |



| ``` 1 ``` | ``` _execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})  ``` |
| --- | --- |




There are limitations:

* They must be strings
* `key` has a maximum length of 50 characters

# Executions | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/





[Skip to content](#executions)







# Executions[#](#executions "Permanent link")

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes[#](#execution-modes "Permanent link")

There are two execution modes:

* Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Test Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
* Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.

## Execution lists[#](#execution-lists "Permanent link")

n8n provides two execution lists:

* [Workflow-level executions](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
* [All executions](/workflows/executions/all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

# Workflow history | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/





[Skip to content](#workflow-history)







# Workflow history[#](#workflow-history "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
* Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
* Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history[#](#understand-workflow-history "Permanent link")

n8n creates a new version when you:

* Save your workflow.
* Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
* Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](/source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history[#](#view-workflow-history "Permanent link")

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
2. Select **Workflow history** ![Workflow history icon](/_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png). n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions[#](#restore-or-copy-previous-versions "Permanent link")

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** ![Options icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
2. Choose what you want to do:
   * **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
   * **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
   * **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
   * **Download**: download the version as JSON.

# Create and run | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/





[Skip to content](#create-a-workflow)







# Create a workflow[#](#create-a-workflow "Permanent link")

A workflow is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the workflow canvas.

## Create a workflow[#](#create-a-workflow_1 "Permanent link")

1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

Or:

1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](/try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually[#](#run-workflows-manually "Permanent link")

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.

To run manually, select **Test Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically[#](#run-workflows-automatically "Permanent link")

All new workflows are inactive by default.

You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.

Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.

# Nodes | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/





[Skip to content](#nodes)







# Nodes[#](#nodes "Permanent link")

Nodes are the key building blocks of a workflow. They perform a range of actions, including:

* Starting the workflow.
* Fetching and sending data.
* Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

* [Built-in integrations](/integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
* [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
* [Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.

## Add a node to your workflow[#](#add-a-node-to-your-workflow "Permanent link")

### Add a node to an empty workflow[#](#add-a-node-to-an-empty-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse trigger nodes.
2. Select the trigger you want to use.
   
   Choose the correct app event
   
   If you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.
   
   For example, this is the trigger for Asana:
   
   ![Screenshot of the Asana node operations list, showing the Recommended section at the top of the list](/_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png)

### Add a node to an existing workflow[#](#add-a-node-to-an-existing-workflow "Permanent link")

Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions[#](#node-operations-triggers-and-actions "Permanent link")

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

* Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](/_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
* Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Node controls[#](#node-controls "Permanent link")

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

* **Test step** ![Test step icon](/_images/common-icons/play-node.png): Run the node.
* **Deactivate** ![Deactivate node icon](/_images/common-icons/power-off.png): Deactivate the node.
* **Delete** ![Delete node icon](/_images/common-icons/delete-node.png): Delete the node.
* **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png): Select node actions. Available actions:
  + Open node
  + Test step
  + Rename node
  + Deactivate node
  + Pin node
  + Copy node
  + Duplicate node
  + Select all
  + Clear selection
  + Delete node

## Node settings[#](#node-settings "Permanent link")

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

* **Request Options**: Select **Add Option** to view and select these options.
  + **Batching**: Control how to batch large numbers of input items.
  + **Ignore SSL Issues**: Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible.
  + **Proxy**: Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
  + **Timeout**: Set a timeout for the request in ms.
* **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
* **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
* **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
* **On Error**:
  + **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
  + **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
  + **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

* **Notes**: Note to save with the node.
* **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.

# 5. Calculating Booked Orders[#](#5-calculating-booked-orders "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n data is structured and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node.

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:

* The total number of booked orders
* The total value of all booked orders

To calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.

## About the Code node[#](#about-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Code node modes

The Code node has two operational **Modes** that change the way it processes data. The **Run Once for All Items** mode allows you to accumulate data from all items on the input list. The **Run Once for Each Item** is used to add custom snippets of JavaScript code that should be executed once for every item that it receives as the input. Learn more about how to use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

* Create your own node.
* Write custom expressions.
* Use the Code node.
* Get the most out of n8n.

In n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following structure:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` [     {    	 // Each item has to contain a "json" property. But it can be an empty object like {}.    	 // Any kind of JSON data is allowed. So arrays and the data being deeply nested is fine.    	 json: { // The actual data n8n operates on (required)    		 // This data is only an example, it could be any kind of JSON data    		 apple: 'beets',    		 carrot: {    			 dill: 1    		 }    	 },    	 // Binary data of item. Most items in n8n do not contain any (optional)    	 binary: {    		 // The key-name "apple" is only an example. Any kind of key-name is possible.    		 apple-picture: {    			 data: '....', // Base64 encoded binary data (required)    			 mimeType: 'image/png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)    			 fileExtension: 'png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)    			 fileName: 'example.png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)    		 }    	 }     },     ... ]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Configure the Code node[#](#configure-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Now let's see how to implement this.

In your workflow, add a Code node **connected to the `false` branch of the** If node.

With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:

* **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**
* **Language**: Select **JavaScript**
* Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box:
  
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` let items = $input.all(); let totalBooked = items.length; let bookedSum = 0;  for(let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {   bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice; } return [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}];  ``` |
  | --- | --- |

Notice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:  

`return [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}]`

Data structure error

If you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: `Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!`

Now select **Test step** and you should see the following results:

![Code node output](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-5-code-node.png)

*Code node output*


Using Python in code nodes

You can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more about this, refer to the [Code node](/code/code-node/) documentation.

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: Wow, the Code node is really powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!

**Nathan üôã**: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step.

# Automating a (real-world) use case | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-3/





[Skip to content](#automating-a-real-world-use-case)







# Automating a (Real-world) Use Case[#](#automating-a-real-world-use-case "Permanent link")

Meet Nathan üôã. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.

Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.

## Understanding the scenario[#](#understanding-the-scenario "Permanent link")

**You üë©‚Äçüîß:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?

**Nathan üôã:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.

I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.

This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get to do it on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?

**Nathan üôã:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!

# Setting values for processing orders | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4/





[Skip to content](#4-setting-values-for-processing-orders)







# 4. Setting Values for Processing Orders[#](#4-setting-values-for-processing-orders "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node.

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to insert the `employeeName` and `orderID` of all `processing` orders into Airtable.

For this, you need to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/), which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one app/service to another.

Edit Fields node

The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.

## Disconnect the Airtable node[#](#disconnect-the-airtable-node "Permanent link")

In your workflow, disconnect the Airtable node **from the** If node in the same way we disconnected it in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson.

## Configure the Edit Fields node[#](#configure-the-edit-fields-node "Permanent link")

Now add a new Edit Fields (Set) node **attached to the** If node's `true` connector by selecting the **+** icon with that connector and searching for **Edit Fields**.

With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:

* Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.
* While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:
  + Drag **orderID** as the first field.
  + Drag **employeeName** as the second field.
* Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.

Select **Test step**. You should see the following results:

![Edit Fields (Set) node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-set-node.png)

*Edit Fields (Set) node*

## Add data to Airtable[#](#add-data-to-airtable "Permanent link")

Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:

1. Go to your Airtable account.
2. Add a new table called `processingOrders`. You can add this table to your existing workspace/table if you choose.
3. Add two columns to this table:
   
   * `orderID`: Number
   * `employeeName`: Single line text
   
   Reminder
   
   If you get stuck, refer back to the [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson.
4. Be sure to delete the three empty rows in the new table!
5. With the new table created, update the Airtable node configuration to point to this new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.
6. Connect the Edit Fields node **connector to the** Airtable node.
7. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.

At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:

![Workflow with the Edit Fields node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-workflow-with-set-node.png)

*Workflow with the Edit Fields node*

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can that be automated as well?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders.

# Filtering orders | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/





[Skip to content](#3-filtering-orders)







# 3. Filtering Orders[#](#3-filtering-orders "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the If node.

To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by `orderStatus`. Basically, we want to tell the program that *if* the `orderStatus` is processing, *then* insert all records with this status into Airtable; *else*, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't *processing*, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus (booked)`.

This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, conditional logic can be implemented with the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

If vs. Switch

If you need to filter data on more than two conditional routes that are possible with the If node (true and false), use the [Switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/). The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Remove the connection to the Airtable node[#](#remove-the-connection-to-the-airtable-node "Permanent link")

First, let's remove the connection between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node:

1. Hover over the arrow connection the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.
2. Select the trash icon to remove the connection.

## Configure the If node[#](#configure-the-if-node "Permanent link")

With the connection to the Airtable node removed, add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:

1. Select the **+** sign coming off the HTTP Request node.
2. Search for the If node.
3. Select it when it appears in the search.

For the If node, we'll use an expression.

Expressions

An expression is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that represents a value depending upon its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.

In the If node window, configure the parameters:

* **Value 1**: `{{ $json.orderStatus }}`
  
  1. To select this value, first hover over the value1 field.
  2. Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Value 1 field.
  3. Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:
     ![Opening the Expression Editor](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-open-editor.png)
     
     *Opening the Expression Editor*
  4. Now use the **Variable Selector** navigation to open **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON**.
  5. Select **orderStatus**.
     ![Expression Editor in the IF node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-expression-editor.png)
     
     *Expression Editor in the If node*
  6. Once the Expression is added, close the **Edit Expression** dialog.
* **Operation**: **String** > **is equal to**
* **Value 2**: processing

Data Type

Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the **Operation**.

Select **Test step** to test the If node.

Your results should look like this:

![If node output](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-output.png)

*If node output*

Note that the orders with `orderStatus` equal to `processing` should show for the True Branch output, while the orders with `orderStatus` equal to `booked` should show in the False Branch output.

## Insert data into Airtable[#](#insert-data-into-airtable "Permanent link")

Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson?

> I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...

Since Nathan only needs the `processing` orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's `true` connector.

In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the **HTTP Request** `true` connector and drag it to the Airtable node.

It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select **Test step**.

Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of `processing`).

At this stage, your workflow should look like this:

![Workflow with the If node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-workflow-with-if-node.png)

*Workflow with the If node*

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: This If node is really useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the `employeeName` and `orderID`, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 features might not seem like a lot to make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and tens of features, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.

**Nathan üôã**: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Sure, I'll do that in the next step.

# Inserting data into airtable | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/





[Skip to content](#2-inserting-data-into-airtable)







# 2. Inserting data into Airtable[#](#2-inserting-data-into-airtable "Permanent link")

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the [Airtable node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

Spreadsheet nodes

You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

![Workflow with the Airtable node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-workflow-with-airtable-node.png)

*Workflow with the Airtable node*

## Configure your table[#](#configure-your-table "Permanent link")

If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:

1. [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).
2. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, *beginner course*.
   
   ![Create an Airtable base](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-create-airtable-base.png)
   
   *Create an Airtable base*
3. In the beginner course base you have by default a **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`.
   These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our orders data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result.
   - Replace the four default table fields with the five column names from the data set, selecting **Number** field type for `orderID`, `customerID`, and `orderPrice`, and **Single line text** for `employeeName` and `orderStatus`.
   - Delete the 3 blank rows created by default.
   - Also, rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.

Now your table should look like this:

![Orders table in Airtable](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-orders-table.png)

*Orders table in Airtable*

Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.

## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node[#](#add-an-airtable-node-to-the-http-request-node "Permanent link")

Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.

Remember

You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.

In the node panel:

1. Search for Airtable.
2. Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.

This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.

In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:

* **Credential to connect with**:
  + Select 'Create new credential'
  + Keep the default option 'Connect using: Access Token' selected
  + **Access token**: Follow the instructions [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) to create your token.
    Adding credentials for Airtable is similar to the HTTP Request node you configured in the previous chapter. However, the process of obtaining an API key for Airtable (and other apps/services) is different.
* **Resource**: Record
* **Operation**: Create. This operation will create the new record in the table.
* **Base**: You can pick your base from a list(e.g beginner course), URL or ID after authenticating. If you wish to use the Base ID, go to [Airtable's API page](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) and find the relevant base (located at the bottom of the page). Then click the base title and you'll find the ID on that page.
* **Table**: orders
* **Mapping Column Mode**: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields are named the same as the columns in Airtable

## Test the Airtable node[#](#test-the-airtable-node "Permanent link")

Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Test step**.

Your results should look like this:

![Airtable node results](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-node.png)

*Airtable node results*

All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:

![Imported records in the orders table](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-records.png)

*Imported records in the orders table*

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: Wow, this automation is really useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status.

# Getting data from the data warehouse | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/





[Skip to content](#1-getting-data-from-the-data-warehouse)







# 1. Getting data from the data warehouse[#](#1-getting-data-from-the-data-warehouse "Permanent link")

In this part of the workflow you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests using the [**HTTP Request**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.

First, let's set up the scene for building Nathan's workflow.

## Create new workflow[#](#create-new-workflow "Permanent link")

Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:

* Select **Ctrl + Alt + N** or **Cmd + Option + N** on your keyboard.
* Open the left menu, navigate to **Workflows**, and select **Add workflow**.

Name this new workflow "Nathan's workflow."

The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.

In the previous chapter, you used an action node connected to a specific app (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.

Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) in n8n.

No node for that service?

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.

## Add an HTTP Request node[#](#add-an-http-request-node "Permanent link")

Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](/courses/level-one/chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.

![HTTP Request node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node.png)

*HTTP Request node*

This node will use credentials.

Credentials

Credentials are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and enable them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.

In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).

In the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:

* **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
* **URL**: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
* **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.
  + **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.
  + **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
* **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials to allow you to access the data.
  + **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)
  + **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **Create New Credential**. This will open the Credentials window.
  + In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
  + In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
  + Click on the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:
    ![HTTP Request node credentials](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-credentials.png)
    
    *HTTP Request node credentials*

Credentials naming

New credentials are named "*node name* account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

## Get the data[#](#get-the-data "Permanent link")

Select the **Test step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The result of the HTTP request should look like this:

![HTTP Request node output](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-window.png)

*HTTP Request node output*

This view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-2/).

This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information of 30 customers with five columns:

* `orderID`: The unique id of each order.
* `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.
* `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague who is responsible for the customer.
* `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.
* `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is booked (booked) or still in processing (processing).

## What's next?[#](#whats-next "Permanent link")

**Nathan üôã**: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the received data into Airtable, as you need it.

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-4/





[Skip to content](#designing-the-workflow)







# Designing the Workflow[#](#designing-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
2. Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
3. Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
4. Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
5. Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
6. Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning

Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:
- Discord
- Airtable

In between, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).

n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:

![Finished workflow](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-four/l1-c4-nathans-workflow.png)

*Nathan's workflow*

You will build this workflow in eight steps:

1. [Getting data from the data warehouse](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)
2. [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/)
3. [Filtering orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/)
4. [Setting values for processing orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4/)
5. [Calculating booked orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.5/)
6. [Notifying the team](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6/)
7. [Scheduling the workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.7/)
8. [Activating and examining the workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.8/)

# Building a mini-workflow | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-2/





[Skip to content](#building-a-mini-workflow)







# Building a Mini-workflow[#](#building-a-mini-workflow "Permanent link")

In this lesson, you will build a small workflow that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The workflow consists of five steps:

1. [Add a Manual Trigger node](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node)
2. [Add the Hacker News node](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node)
3. [Configure the Hacker News node](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node)
4. [Execute the node](#4-execute-the-node)
5. [Save the workflow](#5-save-the-workflow)

## 1. Add a Manual Trigger node[#](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas or selecting Tab on your keyboard).

Then:

1. Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Select it when it appears in the search.

This will add the Manual Trigger node to your canvas, which will allow you to run the workflow any time by selecting the **Test workflow** button.

Manual triggers

For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.

In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to set up a schedule or some other trigger to run the workflow.

## 2. Add the Hacker News node[#](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node "Permanent link")

Select the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.

Then:

1. Search for the **Hacker News** node.
2. Select it when it appears in the search.
3. In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.

n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.

## 3. Configure the Hacker News node[#](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node "Permanent link")

When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:

* **Parameters**: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
* **Settings**: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
* **Docs**: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.

Parameters vs. Settings

**Parameters** are different for each node, depending on its functionality.  

**Settings** are the same for all nodes.

### Parameters[#](#parameters "Permanent link")

We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:

* **Resource**: All   
  
  This resource selects all data records (articles).
* **Operation**: Get Many   
  
  This operation fetches all the selected articles.
* **Limit**: 10   
  
  This parameter sets a limit to how many results the Get Many operation returns.
* **Additional Fields** > **Add Field** > **Keyword**: automation   
  
  **Additional fields** are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword "automation."

The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

![Hacker News node parameters](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c-2-hacker-news-node-parameters.png)

*Hacker News node parameters*

### Settings[#](#settings "Permanent link")

The **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.

In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:

* **Notes**: Get the 10 latest articles.
  
  Node notes
  
  It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is especially helpful for complex or shared workflows!
* **Display note in flow?**: toggle to true  
  
  This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.

The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

![Hacker News node settings](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-hacker-news-node-setting-configuration.png)

*Hacker News node settings*


Renaming a node

You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:

* Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
* Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.
* Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option, or select the node and press F2 on your keyboard.

![Renaming a node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-renaming-a-node-from-the-keyboard.png)

*Renaming a node from the keyboard*


## 4. Execute the node[#](#4-execute-the-node "Permanent link")

Select the **Test step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.


![Results in Table view for the Hacker News node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-table-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)

*Results in Table view for the Hacker News node*

### Node executions[#](#node-executions "Permanent link")

Node execution

A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve the specified data.

If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas

![Successfully executed workflow](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-successfully-executed-workflow.png)

*Successfully executed workflow*

If the parameters are configured correctly and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table**, **JSON**, and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table|JSON|Schema** button at the top of the node window.

Table vs JSON views

The **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.

Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:

![Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-json-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)

*Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node*

The node window displays more information about the node execution:

* Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node executed successfully). If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
  + **Start Time**: When the node execution started
  + **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing
* Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**.
  This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.

Error in nodes

A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.


![Error in nodes](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/error-node.png)

*Error in nodes*

## 5. Save the workflow[#](#5-save-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Once you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.

By default, your workflow is automatically saved as "My workflow."

For this lesson, rename the workflow to be "Hacker News workflow."

Reminder

You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.

Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.

There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:

* From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.
* Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.

## Summary[#](#summary "Permanent link")

Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.

In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work.

# Text courses[#](#text-courses "Permanent link")

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this‚Äìwith no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

# Navigating the editor UI | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-1/





[Skip to content](#navigating-the-editor-ui)







# Navigating the Editor UI[#](#navigating-the-editor-ui "Permanent link")

In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the Editor UI. We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.

## Getting started[#](#getting-started "Permanent link")

Begin by setting up n8n. There are two ways you can do this:

* [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register) - Hosted solution, no installation needed. Great for all levels of experience.
* [Self-host](/hosting/) - Recommended for advanced users with technical knowledge

For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](/choose-n8n/#platforms).

n8n version

This course was developed on n8n version 1.30.0. In other versions, some of the user interface might look different, but the core functionality shouldn't be impacted.

Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. It should look like this:

![Editor UI](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-editor-ui.png)

*Editor UI*

## Editor UI settings[#](#editor-ui-settings "Permanent link")

The [Editor UI](/editor-ui/) is the web interface where you build [workflows](/workflows/workflows/). You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.

### Left-side panel[#](#left-side-panel "Permanent link")

On the left side of the **Editor UI**, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.

The panel contains the following sections:

* **Overview**: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
* **Templates**: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
* **Variables**: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
* **All executions**: Contains information about your workflow executions.
* **Settings**: Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.
* **Help**: Contains resources around n8n product and community.
* **Admin Panel**: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
* **Update**: n8n Cloud only. Indicator for any recently released product updates.

![Editor UI left-side menu](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-side-panel.png)

*Editor UI left-side menu*

### Top bar[#](#top-bar "Permanent link")

The top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:

* **Workflow Name**: By default, n8n names a new workflow as ‚ÄúMy Workflow,‚Äù but you can edit the name at any time.
* **+Add Tag**: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
* **Inactive/active toggle**: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.
* **Share**: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
* **Save**: This button saves the current workflow.

![Editor UI top bar](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-top-bar.png)

*Editor UI top bar*

### Canvas[#](#canvas "Permanent link")

The **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:

* Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and reset the canvas to the original resolution.
* A button to **Execute Workflow**. When you click on it, all nodes on the canvas are executed.
* A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
* A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](/workflows/sticky-notes) to the canvas. (Visible when hovering on the top right + icon)
* A dotted square with the text "Add first step." This is where you add your first node.

![Workflow canvas](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-canvas.png)

*Workflow canvas*


Moving the canvas

You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:

* Select **Ctrl + Left Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.
* Select **Middle Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.
* Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.

Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.

## Nodes[#](#nodes "Permanent link")

You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.

Node

A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.

Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:

* **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.
* **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a full list of trigger nodes.
* **Core Nodes** can be core or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.
* **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. Refer to [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.

Refer to [Node types](/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.

### Finding nodes[#](#finding-nodes "Permanent link")

You can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:

* Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
* Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
* Click the `Tab` key on your keyboard.

![Nodes panel](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-node-menu-drilldown.gif)

*Nodes panel*

In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Action, Data transformation, Helper, Flow and File nodes.

If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.

### Adding nodes[#](#adding-nodes "Permanent link")

There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:

* Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
* Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.

### Node buttons[#](#node-buttons "Permanent link")

If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:

* Execute the node (Play icon)
* Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
* Delete the node (Trash icon)

Additionally, you'll see an elipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](/workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).

Moving a workflow

To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or by selecting **Ctrl + A**, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.

## Summary[#](#summary "Permanent link")

In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas and interpret their execution results.

In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far.

# A longer introduction | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/longer-introduction/





[Skip to content](#a-slightly-longer-introduction)







# A slightly longer introduction[#](#a-slightly-longer-introduction "Permanent link")

This guide shows you how to automate a task using a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:

* Create a workflow from scratch. You'll build a workflow that runs every week to get data from NASA, filters the data, and generates two reports.
* Understand key concepts and skills, including:
  + Starting workflows with trigger nodes
  + Configuring credentials
  + Manipulating data
  + Representing logic in an n8n workflow
  + Using expressions

## Step one: Sign up for n8n[#](#step-one-sign-up-for-n8n "Permanent link")

Skip this section if you've already installed n8n or signed up for a Cloud account

n8n is available as a [Cloud](/choose-n8n/cloud/) service, [npm](/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.

## Step two: New workflow[#](#step-two-new-workflow "Permanent link")

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

* An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
* The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the ![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** to create a new workflow.

## Step three: Add a trigger node[#](#step-three-add-a-trigger-node "Permanent link")

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

* Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**, or from the CLI if you installed n8n with npm or Docker.
* Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.

For this tutorial, use the [Schedule trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:

1. Select **Add first step**.
2. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
4. For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.
5. For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.
6. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.
7. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step four: Add the NASA node and set up credentials[#](#step-four-add-the-nasa-node-and-set-up-credentials "Permanent link")

The [NASA node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) allows you to interact with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/). The API gives you data to work with in this tutorial.

1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the Schedule Trigger node.
2. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.
4. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
5. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:
   1. Select the **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.
   2. Select **- Create New -**. n8n opens the credentials view.
   3. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form in **Generate API Key**. NASA generates the key and displays it.
   4. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.
   5. Select **Save**.
   6. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.
6. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:
   
   1. Select **Add field**.
   2. Select **Start date**.
   3. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button ![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.
   4. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:
      
      | ``` 1 ``` | ``` {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd')}}  ``` |
      | --- | --- |
      
      
      This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.
   
   Date and time in n8n
   
   n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/).
7. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.
8. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.
9. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.

## Step five: Add logic with the If node[#](#step-five-add-logic-with-the-if-node "Permanent link")

n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial, use the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications. You'll create logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.

Add the If node:

1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the NASA node.
2. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
4. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:
   
   1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.
      
      Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section
      
      If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.
   2. Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.
   3. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.
   4. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.

Weeks without large solar flares

In this tutorial, you are working with live date. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**.

5. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.

## Step six: Output data from your workflow[#](#step-six-output-data-from-your-workflow "Permanent link")

The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.

1. On the If node, select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node.png) connector labeled **true**.
2. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **PostBin**.
4. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
5. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.
6. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.
7. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.
8. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button ![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.
9. Select **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON** > **classType**. n8n adds the expression to the **Expression** editor, and displays a sample output.
10. The expression is: `{{$json["classType"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:
    
    | ``` 1 ``` | ``` There was a solar flare of class {{$json["classType"]}}  ``` |
    | --- | --- |
11. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.
12. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.
13. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:
    1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png) > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.
    2. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.

## Step seven: Test the workflow[#](#step-seven-test-the-workflow "Permanent link")

1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
2. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
3. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.

Time limit

Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* Take n8n's [text courses](/courses/) or [video courses](/video-courses/).
* Explore more examples in [workflow templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/).

# A very quick quickstart | n8n Docs  

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/quickstart/





[Skip to content](#the-very-quick-quickstart)







# The very quick quickstart[#](#the-very-quick-quickstart "Permanent link")

This quickstart gives you a quick taste of n8n. Its aim is to allow you to try out the UI, and introduce you to two key features: workflow templates and expressions. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts.

You will:

* Load a workflow from the workflow templates library
* Add a node and configure it using expressions.
* Run your first workflow

## Step one: Sign up for n8n[#](#step-one-sign-up-for-n8n "Permanent link")

Skip this section if you've already installed n8n or signed up for a Cloud account

n8n is available as a [Cloud](/choose-n8n/cloud/) service, [npm](/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.

## Step two: Open a workflow template[#](#step-two-open-a-workflow-template "Permanent link")

n8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. This allows you to work with fake data, and avoids setting up credentials.

1. Go to [Templates | Very quick quickstart](https://n8n.io/workflows/1700-very-quick-quickstart/).
2. Select **Use workflow** to view the options for using the template.
3. Select **Import template to  cloud workspace** to load the template into your Cloud instance.

This workflow:

1. Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.
2. Uses the Edit Fields node to extract just the data you want, and assign that data to variables. In this example, you use the customer name, ID, and description.

The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.

## Step three: Run the workflow[#](#step-three-run-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.

## Step four: Add a node[#](#step-four-add-a-node "Permanent link")

Add a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.

1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the Edit Fields node.
2. Search for **Customer Messenger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **Customer Messenger (n8n training)** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node automatically.
4. Use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to map in the **Customer ID** and create the **Message**:
   1. Drag **customer\_id** from the **INPUT** panel into the **Customer ID** field in the node settings.
   2. Hover over **Message**. Select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button ![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.
   3. Copy this expression into the editor:
      
      | ``` 1 ``` | ``` Hi {{$json.customer_name}},  Your description is {{$json.customer_description}}  ``` |
      | --- | --- |
5. Close the expressions editor, then close the **Customer Messenger** node by clicking outside the node or selecting **Back to canvas**.
6. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow.

The complete workflow should look like this:

![Screenshot of completed quickstart workflow](/_images/try-it-out/quickstart/very-quick-quickstart-workflow.png)

## Next steps[#](#next-steps "Permanent link")

* Read n8n's [longer try it out tutorial](/try-it-out/longer-introduction/) for a more complex workflow, and an introduction to more features and n8n concepts.
* Take the [text courses](/courses/) or [video courses](/video-courses/).

# n8n Integrations Documentation and Guides | n8n Docs 

**URL:** https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/





[Skip to content](#integrations)







# Integrations[#](#integrations "Permanent link")

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes[#](#built-in-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes[#](#community-nodes "Permanent link")

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations[#](#credential-only-nodes-and-custom-operations "Permanent link")

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

* Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
* Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations[#](#generic-integrations "Permanent link")

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

## Where to go next[#](#where-to-go-next "Permanent link")

* If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) section.
* Check out [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
* If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/).
* If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) section.
