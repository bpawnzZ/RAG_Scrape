Plugins

Info

Plugins are created by third parties and not officially affiliated or supported by the core Stash team. If you have issues, please reach out to the original creators.

Plugins adds further features that Stash doesn't itself provide.

Managing plugins¶

Plugins can be installed and managed from the 
 Settings > Plugins page.

Plugins are installed using the Available Plugins section. The Community (stable) source is configured by default.

Installed plugins can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Plugins section.

Adding sources¶

Anyone can create their own source index for plugins. To add a new source go to 
 Settings > Plugins page and under Available Plugins click Add Source.

Installing plugins manually¶

By default, Stash looks for plugin configurations in the plugins sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the %USERPROFILE%\.stash\plugins on Windows or /root/.stash/plugins on Unix systems (Mac, Linux, etc.) or the current working directory.

Plugins are added by adding configuration yaml files (format: pluginName.yml) to the plugins directory.

Loaded plugins can be viewed in the 
 Settings > Plugins page. After plugins are added, removed or edited while Stash is running, they can be reloaded by clicking 
 Reload plugins button.

Stash API¶

The Stash GraphQL API facilitates automated operations through a type-based schema that is both introspective and self-documenting.

Stash includes an integrated playground where users can execute queries and retrieve schema structures and documentation via a special introspection query.

You can access the playground by navigating to <server>:<port>/playground (default: http://localhost:9999/playground).
Click  on the left to access the Documentation Explorer.

All HTTP requests should be directed to <server>:<port>/graphql (default: http://localhost:9999/graphql).

Tip

For further information, visit the official GraphQL site.

Authentication¶

Include the API key generated in Stash in the header of every request. For details on obtaining the API Key, refer to Stash's in-app manual.

Example using curl

Replace <your_api_key> with your API Key found under 
 Settings > Security > Authentication.

Replace <graphql_query> with the raw query, which can be formatted using the playground.

curl -X POST -H "ApiKey: <your_api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql

Legacy cookie authentication¶

For configurations using a username/password, cookies must be used for authentication.

Example using curl
curl --verbose --cookie-jar cookie.txt --data 'username=stash&password=**' localhost:9999/login
curl --cookie cookie.txt -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql


It is recommended to use the API Key method over the legacy cookie method.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Code of conduct
Our Pledge¶

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards¶

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery outside of areas that explicitly allow them, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities¶

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope¶

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, community servers, code repositories, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Enforcement¶

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. You can contact Admin or Org Lead members directly via Discord or using an integrated report function on other platforms.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Enforcement Guidelines¶

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

Warning¶

Offense: First time offence.

Consequence: A public or private written warning depending on the space where offense happened.

Temporary or Permanent Ban¶

Offense: Second time offense.

Consequence: Temporary or permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community and removal of any previously given elevated permissions.

Attribution¶

This Code of Conduct is a modified and adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats.
You can tag videos and find them later.
Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more.

You can learn more about the software generally via the README on the official repository or via the Stash official website.

Windows

Note

Some Windows 11 versions might open Stash via Terminal instead of going to notification area. You can bypass that by running the program as administrator or use a shortcut to run it via conhost.exe.
As a result of running as administrator Stash might fail to detect your Python installtion in PATH, so you need point it the correct way yourself after installation. In 
 Settings > System and under Applications Paths header set Python Executable Path.

Install¶
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

The program will show an icon in your notification area. You can access some quick links or quit the server from there.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the notification area or by stopping the process from Task Manager.
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-win.exe binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete the stash-win.exe binary file.
Delete %userprofile%/.stash folder.

macOS

On macOS, Stash can be run as either a packaged app (Stash.app) or as a command-line app (stash-macos). Both are universal apps, and will therefore run natively on both Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.

Packaged app¶

Note

The packaged app is recommended for most users.

It supports desktop notifications, displays a menu bar icon, and does not need to be launched from the terminal.

However, due to app restrictions, it only supports setting up in $HOME/.stash. If you would like to use a different folder, then you will need to use the command-line app.

Install¶
Download the latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Open Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the menu bar or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Delete old Stash app.
Open newly downloaded Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete Stash app.
Delete $HOME/.stash.
Command-line app¶

Note

The command-line app is only recommended for users who are familiar with the terminal, or for those who do not want to set up in $HOME/.stash.

It does not support desktop notifications and does not display a menu bar icon. It must be launched from the terminal.

Install¶
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either by closing the terminal window or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-macos binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete stash-macos.
Delete $HOME/.stash.

Info

It is recommended that you install ffmpeg from your distribution's package manager. In case you don't, Stash will prompt you to download a copy during setup.

Note

Stash offers different binaries for different architectures. You can find your processor architecture by running a simple command uname -p in a terminal. Replace <binary-name> in the following tutorial accordingly.

stash-linux = amd64 (x86_64)
stash-linux-arm32v6 = arm32v6 (armel)
stash-linux-arm32v7 = arm32v7 (armhf)
stash-linux-arm64v8 = arm64v8 (arm64)

Install¶
Download latest <binary-name> binary from GitHub repository depending on your architecture.
Run ./<binary-name> from the terminal.
If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x <binary-name> to make the file executable.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either by closing the terminal window or by stopping the process from task manager.
Download latest <binary-name> binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old <binary-name> binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.
Run ./<binary-name> from the terminal.
If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x <binary-name> to make the file executable.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.

Info

Before starting make sure your system has Docker installed. You can follow the instructions on how to install Docker from Docker Docs.

Info

Official Stash image is located at stashapp/stash.

Note

Stash README on Docker installation is available here.

Using Docker Compose¶
Install¶
Download and save docker-compose.yml file from our GitHub.
Modify the docker-compose.yml file to your preferences.
Open terminal in the same directory as saved docker-compose.yml or cd to that directory.
Run docker-compose up -d
Installing this way will bound Stash to port 9999.
If everything went well Stash will be available at http://localhost:9999 locally or on your network http://YOUR-LOCAL-IP:9999.
Update¶
Warning
Go to the directory where docker-compose.yml is saved.
Run docker-compose pull. Pulls the new image.
Run docker-compose down. Removes old container.
Run docker-compose up -d. Creates and starts the new container.
Make sure the mount points and settings are the same as in previous docker-compose.yml file.
Remove¶
Go to the directory where docker-compose.yml is saved.
Run docker container kill. Force stops the container.
Run docker container rm. Removes the container.
Delete docker-compose.yml file.

Synology

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

FreeNAS/TrueNAS
TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

Unraid

Info

Unraid app is maintained by a 3rd party. For Unraid specific support you can go to support thread by CorneliousJD.

Note

For users that want to try the development branch of Stash you can change the repository to stashapp/stash:development.

Install¶
Open Unraid and go to the Apps tab.
Enable apps (if disabled) and search for Stash.
You can modify paths to your preference.
Go to Docker tab and enable autostart for Stash.
Optional NVIDIA runtime¶

Info

binarygeek119/stash-cuda:latest repository is not maintained by Stash core team.

First off you need the unraid Nvidia plugin for this to work. On Unraid go to apps and do a search for nvidia driver and install, this will take some time to install. When the dialog is done it is still installing in the background. When it has finshed you will get a popup saying it is safe to reboot now.

Warning

Do not restart Unraid server until the plugin is done installing itself!

After getting the popup, reboot your server. After it back online you may continue to the next steps.

To begin modifing start by going into edit mode by right click on stash icon on Unraid dashboard or in Docker tab.
In edit mode go to the top and click on basic view to switch to advaced view.

 

Container configuration¶

Now we can change some thing to have Stash work with a Nvidia GPU.

Under Repository change the default Repository from stashapp/stash:development to binarygeek119/stash-cuda:latest.
 
Add the following under Extra Parameters: --runtime=nvidia.
 
Go down to the bottom of the page and click on Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device.

Change path to Variable and add the following:
Name: enter NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
Key: enter NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
Value: enter all
and click save.
  
Go down to the bottom of the page and click on Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device.

Change path to Variable and add the following:
Name: enter NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
Key: enter NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
Value: enter GPU-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   
Locating GPUID¶

Where GPU-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx you must enter your own GPUID. To find it do the folowing:

On a new Unraid page click on settings.
Go down to the bottom and click Nvidia Driver plugin.
Copy the key and paste it under Variable called Value.

Click on save.
Now click on apply and let the Docker download the new Nvidia version of Stash.
Enjoy and use as before.

Introduction¶

Stash works by cataloging your media using the paths that you provide. Once you have configured the locations where your media is stored, you can click the Scan button in Settings -> Tasks and stash will begin scanning and importing your media into its library.

For the best experience, it is recommended that after a scan is finished, that video previews and sprites are generated. You can do this in Settings -> Tasks. Note that currently it is only possible to perform one task at a time and but there is a task queue, so the generate tasks should be performed after scan is complete.

Once your media is imported, you are ready to begin creating Performers, Studios and Tags, and curating your content!

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Interface Options¶
Language¶

Setting the language affects the formatting of numbers and dates.

Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type¶

The Scene Wall and Marker pages display scene preview videos (mp4) by default. This can be changed to animated image (webp) or static image.

⚠️ Note: scene/marker preview videos must be generated to see them in the applicable wall page if Video preview type is selected. Likewise, if Animated Image is selected, then Image Previews must be generated.

Show Studios as text¶

By default, a scene's studio will be shown as an image overlay. Checking this option changes this to display studios as a text name instead.

Scene Player options¶

By default, scene videos do not automatically start when navigating to the scenes page. Checking the "Auto-start video" option changes this to auto play scene videos.

The maximum loop duration option allows looping of shorter videos. Set this value to the maximum scene duration that scene videos should loop. Setting this to 0 disables this functionality.

Activity tracking¶

The "Track Activity" option allows tracking of scene play count and duration, and sets the resume point when a scene video is not finished.

The "Minimum Play Percent" gives the minimum proportion of a video that must be played before the play count of the scene is incremented.

By default, when a scene has a resume point, the scene player will automatically seek to this point when the scene is played. Setting "Always start video from beginning" to true disables this behaviour.

Custom CSS¶

The stash UI can be customised using custom CSS. See here for a community-curated set of CSS snippets to customise your UI.

Stash Plex Theme is a community created theme inspired by the popular Plex interface.

Custom Javascript¶

Stash supports the injection of custom javascript to assist with theming or adding additional functionality. Be aware that bad Javascript could break the UI or worse.

Custom Locales¶

The localisation strings can be customised. The master list of default (en-GB) locale strings can be found here. The custom locale format is the same as this json file.

For example, to override the actions.add_directory label (which is Add Directory by default), you would have the following in the custom locale:

{
  "actions": {
    "add_directory": "Some other description"
  }
}

Custom served folders¶

It is possible to expose specific folders to the UI. This configuration is performed manually in the config.yml file only.

Custom served content is exposed via the /custom URL path prefix.

For example, in the config.yml file:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would return D:\bar\bar.png. The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would return D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Applications for this include using static images in custom css, like the Plex theme. For example, using the following config:

custom_served_folders:
  /: <stash folder>\custom


The background.png and noise.png files can be placed in the custom folder, then in the custom css, the ./background.png and ./noise.png strings can be replaced with /custom/background.png and /custom/noise.png respectively.

Other applications are to add custom UIs to stash, accessible via /custom.

Tasks¶

This page allows you to direct the stash server to perform a variety of tasks.

Scanning¶

The scan function walks through the stash directories you have configured for new and moved files.

Stash currently identifies files by performing a quick file hash. This means that if the file is renamed for moved elsewhere within your configured stash directories, then the scan will detect this and update its database accordingly.

Stash currently ignores duplicate files. If two files contain identical content, only the first one it comes across is used.

The scan task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Generate scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Generate previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Generate animated image previews*	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Generate scrubber sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Generate perceptual hashes	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate thumbnails for images	Generates thumbnails for image files.
Generate previews for image clips	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Rescan	By default, Stash will only rescan existing files if the file's modified date has been updated since its previous scan. Stash will rescan files in the path when this option is enabled, regardless of the file modification time. Only required Stash needs to recalculate video/image metadata, or to rescan gallery zips.
Auto Tagging¶

See the Auto Tagging page.

Scene Filename Parser¶

See the Scene Filename Parser page.

Generated Content¶

The scanning function automatically generates a screenshot of each scene. The generated content provides the following:

Video or image previews that are played when mousing over the scene card
Perceptual hashes - helps match against StashDB, and feeds the duplicate finder
Sprites (scene stills for parts of each scene) that are shown in the scene scrubber
Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Marker Screenshots	Generates static JPG images for markers. Only required if Preview Type is set to Static Image. Requires Marker Previews to be enabled.
Transcodes	Accessible in Advanced Mode - MP4 conversions of unsupported video formats. Allows direct streaming instead of live transcoding.
Perceptual hashes (for deduplication)	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes	Generates heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes.
Image Clip Previews	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Overwrite existing generated files	By default, where a generated file exists, it is not regenerated. When this flag is enabled, then the generated files are regenerated.
Transcodes¶

Web browsers support a limited number of video and audio codecs and containers. Stash will directly stream video files where the browser supports the codecs and container. Originally, stash did not support viewing scene videos where the browser did not support the codecs/container, and generating transcodes was a way of viewing these files.

Stash has since implemented live transcoding, so transcodes are essentially unnecessary now. Further, transcodes use up a significant amount of disk space and are not guaranteed to be lossless.

Image gallery thumbnails¶

These are generated when the gallery is first viewed, so generating them beforehand is not necessary.

Cleaning¶

This task will walk through your configured media directories and remove any scene from the database that can no longer be found. It will also remove generated files for scenes that subsequently no longer exist.

Care should be taken with this task, especially where the configured media directories may be inaccessible due to network issues.

Exporting and Importing¶

The import and export tasks read and write JSON files to the configured metadata directory. Import from file will merge your database with a file.

⚠️ Note: The full import task wipes the current database completely before importing.

See the JSON Specification page for details on the exported JSON format.

Identify¶

This task iterates through your Scenes and attempts to identify the scene using a selection of scraping sources.

This task accepts one or more scraper sources. Valid scraper sources for the Identify task are stash-box instances, and scene scrapers which support scraping via Scene Fragment. The order of the sources may be rearranged.

For each Scene, the Identify task iterates through the scraper sources, in the order provided, and tries to identify the scene using each source. If a result is found in a source, then the Scene is updated, and no further sources are checked for that scene.

Options¶

The following options can be set:

Option	Description
Include male performers	If false, then male performers will not be created or set on scenes.
Set cover images	If false, then scene cover images will not be modified.
Set organised flag	If true, the organised flag is set to true when a scene is organised.
Skip matches that have more than one result	If this is not enabled and more than one result is returned, one will be randomly chosen to match
Tag skipped matches with	If the above option is set and a scene is skipped, this will add the tag so that you can filter for it in the Scene Tagger view and choose the correct match by hand
Skip single name performers with no disambiguation	If this is not enabled, performers that are often generic like Samantha or Olga will be matched
Tag skipped performers with	If the above options is set and a performer is skipped, this will add the tag so that you can filter for in it the Scene Tagger view and choose how you want to handle those performers

Field specific options may be set as well. Each field may have a Strategy. The behaviour for each strategy value is as follows:

Strategy	Description
Ignore	Not set.
Overwrite	Overwrite existing value.
Merge (default)	For multi-value fields, adds to existing values. For single-value fields, only sets if not already set.

For Studio, Performers and Tags, an option is also available to Create Missing objects. This is enabled by default. When true, if a Studio/Performer/Tag is included during the identification process and does not exist in the system, then it will be created.

Default Options are applied to all sources unless overridden in specific source options.

The result of the identification process for each scene is output to the log.

Auto Tagging¶

When media filepaths or filenames contain a Performer, Studio, or Tag name, it is assigned those Performers, Studios, and Tags. It will only tag based on Performer, Studio, and Tag names that exist in your database.

When the Performer/Studio/Tag name has multiple words, the search will include paths/filenames where the Performer/Studio/Tag name is separated with ., -, _, and whitespace characters.

For example, auto tagging for performer Jane Doe will match the following filenames:

Jane.Doe.1.mp4
Jane_Doe.2.mp4
Jane-Doe.3.mp4
Jane Doe.4.mp4

Matching is case insensitive, and should only match exact wording within word boundaries. For example, the tag Jane Doe will not match Maryjane-Doe or Jane-Doen, but will match Mary-Jane-Doe, Jane-Doe_n, and [OF]jane doe.

Auto tagging for specific Performers, Studios, and Tags can be performed from the individual Performer/Studio/Tag page.

Note: Performer autotagging does not currently match on performer aliases.

Scene Filename Parser¶

This tool parses the scene filenames in your library and allows setting the metadata from those filenames.

Parser Options¶

To use this tool, a filename pattern must be entered. The pattern accepts the following fields:

Field	Remark
title	Text captured within is set as the title of the scene.
ext	Matches the end of the filename. It is not captured. Does not include the last . character.
d	Matches delimiter characters (-_.). Not captured.
i	Matches any ignored word entered in the Ignored words field. Ignored words are entered as space-delimited words. Not captured. Use this to match release artifacts like DVDRip or release groups.
date	Matches yyyy-mm-dd and sets the date of the scene.
rating	Matches a single digit and sets the rating of the scene.
performer	Sets the scene performer, based on the text captured.
tag	Sets the scene tag, based on the text captured.
studio	Sets the studio performer, based on the text captured.
{}	Matches any characters. Not captured.

⚠️ Note: performer, tag and studio fields will only match against Performers/Tags/Studios that already exist in the system.

The performer/tag/studio fields will remove any delimiter characters (.-_) before querying. Name matching is case-insensitive.

The following partial date fields are also supported. The date will only be set on the scene if a date string can be built using the partial date components:

Field	Remark
yyyy	Four digit year
yy	Two digit year. Assumes the first two digits are 20
mm	Two digit month
mmm	Three letter month, such as Jan (case-insensitive)
dd	Two digit date

The following full date fields are supported, using the same partial date rules as above:

yyyymmdd
yymmdd
ddmmyyyy
ddmmyy
mmddyyyy
mmddyy

All of these fields are available from the Add Field button.

Title generation also has the following options:

Option	Remark
Whitespace characters	These characters are replaced with whitespace (defaults to ._, to handle filenames like three.word.title.avi
Capitalize title	capitalises the first letter of each word

The fields to display can be customised with the Display Fields drop-down section. By default, any field with new/different values will be displayed.

Applying the results¶

Once the options are correct, click on the Find button. The system will search for scenes that have filenames that match the given pattern.

The results are presented in a table showing the existing and generated values of the discovered fields, along with a checkbox to determine whether or not the field will be set on each scene. These fields can also be edited manually.

The Apply button updates the scenes based on the set fields.

⚠️ Note: results are paged and the Apply button only applies to scenes on the current page.

Import/Export JSON Specification¶

The metadata given to Stash can be exported into the JSON format. This structure can be modified, or replicated by other means. The resulting data can then be imported again, giving the possibility for automatic scraping of all kinds. The format of this metadata bulk is a folder structure, containing the following folders:

files
galleries
images
performers
scenes
studios
groups
File naming¶

When exported, files are named with different formats depending on the object type:

Type	Format
Files/Folders	<path depth in hex, two character width>.<basename>.<hash>.json
Galleries	<first zip filename>.<path hash>.json or <folder basename>.<path hash>.json or <title>.json
Images	<title or first file basename>.<hash>.json
Performers	<name>.json
Scenes	<title or first file basename>.<hash>.json
Studios	<name>.json
Groups	<name>.json

Note that the file naming is not significant when importing. All json files will be read from the subdirectories.

Content of the json files¶

In the following, the values of the according jsons will be shown. If the value should be a number, it is written with after comma values (like 29.98 or 50.0), but still as a string. The meaning from most of them should be obvious due to the previous explanation or from the possible values stash offers when editing, otherwise a short comment will be added.

The json values are given as strings, if not stated otherwise. Every new line will stand for a new value in the json. If the value is a list of objects, the values of that object will be shown indented.

If a value is empty in any file, it can be left out of the file entirely. Many files have an created_at and updated_at, both are kept in the following format:

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD  

Example:

"created_at": "2019-05-03T21:36:58+01:00"

Browsing¶
Querying and Filtering¶
Keyword searching¶

The text field allows you to search using keywords. Keyword searching matches on different fields depending on the object type:

Type	Fields searched
Scene	Title, Details, Path, OSHash, Checksum, Marker titles
Image	Title, Path, Checksum
Group	Title
Marker	Title, Scene title
Gallery	Title, Path, Checksum
Performer	Name, Aliases
Studio	Name, Aliases
Tag	Name, Aliases

Keyword matching uses the following rules:

all words are required in the matching field. For example, foo bar matches scenes with both foo and bar in the title.
the or keyword or symbol (|) is used to match either fields. For example, foo or bar (or foo | bar) matches scenes with foo or bar in the title. Or sets can be combined. For example, foo or bar or baz xyz or zyx matches scenes with one of foo, bar and baz, and xyz or zyx.
the not symbol (-) is used to exclude terms. For example, foo -bar matches scenes with foo and excludes those with bar. The not symbol cannot be combined with an or operand. That is, -foo or bar will be interpreted to match -foo or bar. On the other hand, foo or bar -baz will match foo or bar and exclude baz.
surrounding a phrase in quotes (") matches on that exact phrase. For example, "foo bar" matches scenes with foo bar in the title. Quotes may also be used to escape the keywords and symbols. For example, foo "-bar" will match scenes with foo and -bar.
quoted phrases may be used with the or and not operators. For example, "foo bar" or baz -"xyz zyx" will match scenes with foo bar or baz, and exclude those with xyz zyx.
or keywords or symbols at the start or end of a line will be treated literally. That is, or foo will match scenes with or and foo.
all keyword matching is case-insensitive
Filters¶

Filters can be accessed by clicking the filter button on the right side of the query text field.

Note that only one filter criterion per criterion type may be assigned.

Regex modifiers¶

Some filters have regex modifier as an option. Regex modifiers are case-sensitive by default.

Sorting and page size¶

The current sorting field is shown next to the query text field, indicating the current sort field and order. The page size dropdown allows selecting from a standard set of objects per page, and allows setting a custom page size.

Saved filters¶

Saved filters can be accessed with the bookmark button on the left of the query text field. The current filter can be saved by entering a filter name and clicking on the save button. Existing saved filters may be overwritten with the current filter by clicking on the save button next to the filter name. Saved filters may also be deleted by pressing the delete button next to the filter name.

Saved filters are sorted alphabetically by title with capitalized titles sorted first.

Default filter¶

The default filter for the top-level pages may be set to the current filter by clicking the Set as default button in the saved filter menu.

Images and Galleries¶

Images are the parts which make up galleries, but you can also have them be scanned independently. To declare an image part of a gallery, there are four ways:

Group them in a folder together and activate the Create galleries from folders containing images option in the library section of your settings. The gallery will get the name of the folder.
Group them in a folder together and create a file in the folder called .forcegallery. The gallery will get the name of the folder.
Group them into a zip archive together. The gallery will get the name of the archive.
You can simply create a gallery in stash itself by clicking on New in the Galleries tab.

You can add images to every gallery manually in the gallery detail page. Deleting can be done by selecting the according images in the same view and clicking on the minus next to the edit button.

For best results, images in zip file should be stored without compression (copy, store or no compression options depending on the software you use. Eg on linux: zip -0 -r gallery.zip foldertozip/). This impacts heavily on the zip read performance.

If a filename of an image in the gallery zip file ends with cover.jpg, it will be treated like a cover and presented first in the gallery view page and as a gallery cover in the gallery list view. If more than one images match the name the first one found in natural sort order is selected.

Image clips/gifs¶

Images can also be clips/gifs. These are meant to be short video loops. Right now they are not possible in zipfiles. To declare video files to be images, there are two ways:

Deactivate video scanning for all libraries that contain clips/gifs, but keep image scanning active. Set the Scan Video Extensions as Image Clip option in the library section of your settings.
Make sure none of the file endings used by your clips/gifs are present in the Video Extensions and add them to the Image Extensions in the library section of your settings.

A clip/gif will be a stillframe in the wall and grid view by default. To view the loop, you can go into the Lightbox Carousel (e.g. by clicking on an image in the wall view) or the image detail page.

If you want the loop to be used as a preview on the wall and grid view, you will have to generate them. You can do this as you scan for the new clip file by activating Generate previews for image clips on the scan settings, or do it after by going to the Generated Content section in the task section of your settings, activating Image Clip Previews and clicking generate. This takes a while, as the files are transcoded.

Metadata Scraping¶

Stash supports scraping of metadata from various external sources.

Scraper Types¶
Type	Description
Fragment	Uses existing metadata for an Item and match it to a result from a metadata source.
Search/By Name	Uses a provided query string to search a metadata source for a list of matches for the user to pick from.
URL	Extracts metadata from a given URL.
Supported Scrapers¶
	Fragment	Search	URL
gallery	✔️		✔️
group			✔️
performer		✔️	✔️
scene	✔️	✔️	✔️
Included Scrapers¶

Stash provides the following built-in scrapers:

Scraper	Description
Freeones	search Performer scraper for freeones.xxx.
Auto Tag	Scene fragment scraper that matches existing performers, studio and tags using the filename.
Managing Scrapers¶

Scrapers can be installed and managed from the Settings > Metadata Providers page.

Scrapers are installed using the Available Scrapers section. This section allows configuring sources from which to install scrapers. The Community (stable) source is configured by default. This source contains scrapers for the current stable version of stash.

These are the scraper sources maintained by the stashapp organisation:

Name	Source URL	Recommended Local Path	Notes
Community (stable)	https://stashapp.github.io/CommunityScrapers/stable/index.yml	stable	For the current stable version of stash.
Community (develop)	https://stashapp.github.io/CommunityScrapers/develop/index.yml	develop	For the develop version of stash.

Installed scrapers can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Scrapers section.

Source URLs¶

The source URL must return a yaml file containing all the available packages for the source. An example source yaml file looks like the following:

- id: <package id>
  name: <package name>
  version: <version>
  date: <date>
  requires:
  - <ids of packages required by this package (optional)>
  - ...
  path: <path to package zip file>
  sha256: <sha256 of zip>
  metadata:
    <optional key/value pairs for extra information>
- ...


Path can be a relative path to the zip file or an external URL.

Adding Scrapers manually¶

By default, Stash looks for scraper configurations in the scrapers sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the $HOME/.stash directory or the current working directory.

Scrapers are added manually by placing yaml configuration files (format: scrapername.yml) in the scrapers directory.

⚠️ Note: Some scrapers may require more than just the yaml file, consult the individual scraper documentation

After the yaml files are added, removed or edited while stash is running, they can be reloaded going to Settings > Metadata Providers > Scrapers and clicking Reload Scrapers.

Using Scrapers¶
Fragment Scraper¶

Click on the Scrape With... button in the edit tab of an item, then select the scraper you wish to use.

Search Scraper¶

Click on the 🔍 button in the edit tab of an item. You will be presented with a search dialog with a pre-populated query to search for, after searching you will be presented with a list of results to pick from

URL Scraper¶

Enter the URL in the edit tab of an Item. If a scraper is installed that supports that url, then a button will appear to scrape the metadata.

Tagger View¶

The Tagger view is accessed from the scenes page. It allows the user to run scrapers on all items on the current page. The Tagger presents the user with potential matches for an item from a selected stash-box instance or metadata source if supported. The user needs to select the correct metadata information to save.

When used in combination with stash-box, the user can optionally submit scene fingerprints to contribute to a stash-box instance. A scene fingerprint consists of any generated hashes (phash, oshash, md5) and the scene duration. Fingerprint submissions are associated with your stash-box account. Submitting fingerprints assists others in matching their files, because stash-box returns a count of matching user submitted fingerprints with every potential match.

	Has Tagger	Source Selection
gallery		
group		
performer	✔️	
scene	✔️	✔️
Identify Task¶

This task iterates through your Scenes and attempts to identify the scene using a selection of scraping sources. This task can be found under Settings -> Tasks -> "Identify..." (Button). For more information see the Tasks > Identify page.

Contributing Scrapers¶

Scrapers can be contributed to the community by creating a PR in this repository.

Scraper configuration file format¶
name: <site>
performerByName:
  <single scraper config>
performerByFragment:
  <single scraper config>
performerByURL:
  <multiple scraper URL configs>
sceneByName:
  <single scraper config>
sceneByQueryFragment:
  <single scraper config>
sceneByFragment:
  <single scraper config>
sceneByURL:
  <multiple scraper URL configs>
groupByURL:
  <multiple scraper URL configs>
galleryByFragment:
  <single scraper config>
galleryByURL:
  <multiple scraper URL configs>
<other configurations>


name is mandatory, all other top-level fields are optional. The inclusion of each top-level field determines what capabilities the scraper has.

A scraper configuration in any of the top-level fields must at least have an action field. The other fields are required based on the value of the action field.

The scraping types and their required fields are outlined in the following table:

Behavior	Required configuration
Scraper in Scrape... dropdown button in Performer Edit page	Valid performerByName and performerByFragment configurations.
Scrape performer from URL	Valid performerByURL configuration with matching URL.
Scraper in query dropdown button in Scene Edit page	Valid sceneByName and sceneByQueryFragment configurations.
Scraper in Scrape... dropdown button in Scene Edit page	Valid sceneByFragment configuration.
Scrape scene from URL	Valid sceneByURL configuration with matching URL.
Scrape group from URL	Valid groupByURL configuration with matching URL. Note: movieByURL is also supported but is deprecated.
Scraper in Scrape... dropdown button in Gallery Edit page	Valid galleryByFragment configuration.
Scrape gallery from URL	Valid galleryByURL configuration with matching URL.

URL-based scraping accepts multiple scrape configurations, and each configuration requires a url field. stash iterates through these configurations, attempting to match the entered URL against the url fields in the configuration. It executes the first scraping configuration where the entered URL contains the value of the url field.

Actions¶
Script¶

Executes a script to perform the scrape. The script field is required for this action and accepts a list of string arguments. For example:

action: script
script:
  - python
  - iafdScrape.py
  - query


If the script specifies the python executable, Stash will find the correct python executable for your system, either python or python3. So for example. this configuration could execute python iafdScrape.py query or python3 iafdScrape.py query. python3 will be looked for first and if it's not found, we'll check for python. In the case neither are found, you will get an error.

Stash sends data to the script process's stdin stream and expects the output to be streamed to the stdout stream. Any errors and progress messages should be output to stderr.

The script is sent input and expects output based on the scraping type, as detailed in the following table:

Scrape type	Input	Output
performerByName	{"name": "<performer query string>"}	Array of JSON-encoded performer fragments (including at least name)
performerByFragment	JSON-encoded performer fragment	JSON-encoded performer fragment
performerByURL	{"url": "<url>"}	JSON-encoded performer fragment
sceneByName	{"name": "<scene query string>"}	Array of JSON-encoded scene fragments
sceneByQueryFragment, sceneByFragment	JSON-encoded scene fragment	JSON-encoded scene fragment
sceneByURL	{"url": "<url>"}	JSON-encoded scene fragment
groupByURL	{"url": "<url>"}	JSON-encoded group fragment
galleryByFragment	JSON-encoded gallery fragment	JSON-encoded gallery fragment
galleryByURL	{"url": "<url>"}	JSON-encoded gallery fragment

For performerByName, only name is required in the returned performer fragments. One entire object is sent back to performerByFragment to scrape a specific performer, so the other fields may be included to assist in scraping a performer. For example, the url field may be filled in for the specific performer page, then performerByFragment can extract by using its value.

Python example of a performer Scraper:

import json
import sys
import string

def readJSONInput():
    input = sys.stdin.read()
    return json.loads(input)


def searchPerformer(name):
    # perform scraping here - using name for the query

    # fill in the output
    ret = []

    # example shown for a single found performer 
    p = {}
    p['name'] = "some name"
    p['url'] = "performer url"
    ret.append(p)

    return ret

def scrapePerformer(input):
    ret = []
    # get the url from the input
    url = input['url']
    return scrapePerformerURL(url)

def debugPrint(t):
    sys.stderr.write(t + "\n")

def scrapePerformerURL(url):
    debugPrint("Reading url...")
    debugPrint("Parsing html...")

    # parse html

    # fill in performer details - single object
    ret = {}

    ret['name'] = "fred"
    ret['aliases'] = "freddy"
    ret['ethnicity'] = ""
    # and so on

    return ret

# read the input 
i = readJSONInput()

if sys.argv[1] == "query":
    ret = searchPerformer(i['name'])
    print(json.dumps(ret))
elif sys.argv[1] == "scrape":
    ret = scrapePerformer(i)
    print(json.dumps(ret))
elif sys.argv[1] == "scrapeURL":
    ret = scrapePerformerURL(i['url'])
    print(json.dumps(ret))

scrapeXPath¶

This action scrapes a web page using an xpath configuration to parse. This action is not valid for performerByFragment.

This action requires that the top-level xPathScrapers configuration is populated. The scraper field is required and must match the name of a scraper name configured in xPathScrapers. For example:

sceneByURL:
- action: scrapeXPath
  url: 
    - pornhub.com/view_video.php
  scraper: sceneScraper


The above configuration requires that sceneScraper exists in the xPathScrapers configuration.

XPath scraping configurations specify the mapping between object fields and an xpath selector. The xpath scraper scrapes the applicable URL and uses xpath to populate the object fields.

scrapeJson¶

This action works in the same way as scrapeXPath, but uses a mapped json configuration to parse. It uses the top-level jsonScrapers configuration. This action is not valid for performerByFragment.

JSON scraping configurations specify the mapping between object fields and a GJSON selector. The JSON scraper scrapes the applicable URL and uses GJSON to parse the returned JSON object and populate the object fields.

scrapeXPath and scrapeJson use with performerByName¶

For performerByName, the queryURL field must be present also. This field is used to perform a search query URL for performer names. The placeholder string sequence {} is replaced with the performer name search string. For the subsequent performer scrape to work, the URL field must be filled in with the URL of the performer page that matches a URL given in a performerByURL scraping configuration. For example:

name: Boobpedia
performerByName:
  action: scrapeXPath
  queryURL: http://www.boobpedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search={}&fulltext=Search
  scraper: performerSearch
performerByURL:
  - action: scrapeXPath
    url: 
      - boobpedia.com/boobs/
    scraper: performerScraper
xPathScrapers:
  performerSearch:
    performer:
      Name: # name element
      URL: # URL element that matches the boobpedia.com/boobs/ URL above
  performerScraper:
    # ... performer scraper details ...

scrapeXPath and scrapeJson use with sceneByFragment and sceneByQueryFragment¶

For sceneByFragment and sceneByQueryFragment, the queryURL field must also be present. This field is used to build a query URL for scenes. For sceneByFragment, the queryURL field supports the following placeholder fields:

{checksum} - the MD5 checksum of the scene
{oshash} - the oshash of the scene
{filename} - the base filename of the scene
{title} - the title of the scene
{url} - the url of the scene

These placeholder field values may be manipulated with regex replacements by adding a queryURLReplace section, containing a map of placeholder field to regex configuration which uses the same format as the replace post-process action covered below.

For example:

sceneByFragment:
  action: scrapeJson
  scraper: sceneQueryScraper
  queryURL: https://metadataapi.net/api/scenes?parse={filename}&limit=1
  queryURLReplace:
    filename:
      - regex: <some regex>
        with: <replacement>


The above configuration would scrape from the value of queryURL, replacing {filename} with the base filename of the scene, after it has been manipulated by the regex replacements.

scrapeXPath and scrapeJson use with <scene|performer|gallery|group>ByURL¶

For sceneByURL, performerByURL, galleryByURL the queryURL can also be present if we want to use queryURLReplace. The functionality is the same as sceneByFragment, the only placeholder field available though is the url: * {url} - the url of the scene/performer/gallery

sceneByURL:
  - action: scrapeJson
    url:
      - metartnetwork.com
    scraper: sceneScraper
    queryURL: "{url}"
    queryURLReplace:
      url:
        - regex: '^(?:.+\.)?([^.]+)\.com/.+movie/(\d+)/(\w+)/?$'
          with: https://www.$1.com/api/movie?name=$3&date=$2

Stash¶

A different stash server can be configured as a scraping source. This action applies only to performerByName, performerByFragment, and sceneByFragment types. This action requires that the top-level stashServer field is configured.

stashServer contains a single url field for the remote stash server. The username and password can be embedded in this string using username:password@host. Alternatively, the apiKey field can be used to authenticate with the remote stash server.

An example stash scrape configuration is below:

name: stash
performerByName:
  action: stash
performerByFragment:
  action: stash
sceneByFragment:
  action: stash
stashServer:
  apiKey: <api key>
  url: http://stashserver.com:9999

Xpath and JSON scrapers configuration¶

The top-level xPathScrapers field contains xpath scraping configurations, freely named. These are referenced in the scraper field for scrapeXPath scrapers.

Likewise, the top-level jsonScrapers field contains json scraping configurations.

Collectively, these configurations are known as mapped scraping configurations.

A mapped scraping configuration may contain a common field, and must contain performer, scene, group or gallery depending on the scraping type it is configured for.

Within the performer/scene/group/gallery field are key/value pairs corresponding to the golang fields on the performer/scene object. These fields are case-sensitive.

The values of these may be either a simple selector value, which tells the system where to get the value of the field from, or a more advanced configuration (see below). For example, for an xpath configuration:

performer:
  Name: //h1[@itemprop="name"]


This will set the Name attribute of the returned performer to the text content of the element that matches <h1 itemprop="name">....

For a json configuration:

performer:
  Name: data.name


The value may also be a sub-object. If it is a sub-object, then the selector must be set to the selector key of the sub-object. For example, using the same xpath as above:

performer:
  Name: 
    selector: //h1[@itemprop="name"]
    postProcess:
      # post-processing config values

Fixed attribute values¶

Alternatively, an attribute value may be set to a fixed value, rather than scraping it from the webpage. This can be done by replacing selector with fixed. For example:

performer:
  Gender: 
    fixed: Female

Common fragments¶

The common field is used to configure selector fragments that can be referenced in the selector strings. These are key-value pairs where the key is the string to reference the fragment, and the value is the string that the fragment will be replaced with. For example:

common:
  $infoPiece: //div[@class="infoPiece"]/span
performer:
  Measurements: $infoPiece[text() = 'Measurements:']/../span[@class="smallInfo"]


The Measurements xpath string will replace $infoPiece with //div[@class="infoPiece"]/span, resulting in: //div[@class="infoPiece"]/span[text() = 'Measurements:']/../span[@class="smallInfo"].

⚠️ Note: Recursive common fragments are not supported.
Referencing a common fragment within another common fragment will cause an error. For example:

common:
  $info: //div[@class="info"]
  # Referencing $info in $models will cause an error
  $models: $info/a[@class="model"]
scene:
  Title: $info/h1
  Performers:
    Name: $models
    URL: $models/@href


Post-processing options¶

Post-processing operations are contained in the postProcess key. Post-processing operations are performed in the order they are specified. The following post-processing operations are available: * javascript: accepts a javascript code block, that must return a string value. The input string is declared in the value variable. If an error occurs while compiling or running the script, then the original value is returned. Example:

performer:
  Name:
    selector: //div[@class="example element"]
    postProcess:
      - javascript: |
          // capitalise the first letter
          if (value && value.length) {
            return value[0].toUpperCase() + value.substring(1)
          }

Note that the otto javascript engine is missing a few built-in methods and may not be consistent with other modern javascript implementations. * feetToCm: converts a string containing feet and inches numbers into centimeters. Looks for up to two separate integers and interprets the first as the number of feet, and the second as the number of inches. The numbers can be separated by any non-numeric character including the . character. It does not handle decimal numbers. For example 6.3 and 6ft3.3 would both be interpreted as 6 feet, 3 inches before converting into centimeters. * lbToKg: converts a string containing lbs to kg. * map: contains a map of input values to output values. Where a value matches one of the input values, it is replaced with the matching output value. If no value is matched, then value is unmodified.

Example:

performer:
  Gender:
    selector: //div[@class="example element"]
    postProcess:
      - map:
          F: Female
          M: Male
  Height:
    selector: //span[@id="height"]
    postProcess:
      - feetToCm: true
  Weight:
    selector: //span[@id="weight"]
    postProcess:
      - lbToKg: true

Gets the contents of the selected div element, and sets the returned value to Female if the scraped value is F; Male if the scraped value is M. Height and weight are extracted from the selected spans and converted to cm and kg.

parseDate: if present, the value is the date format using go's reference date (2006-01-02). For example, if an example date was 14-Mar-2003, then the date format would be 02-Jan-2006. See the time.Parse documentation for details. When present, the scraper will convert the input string into a date, then convert it to the string format used by stash (YYYY-MM-DD). Strings "Today", "Yesterday" are matched (case insensitive) and converted by the scraper so you don't need to edit/replace them. Unix timestamps (example: 1660169451) can also be parsed by selecting unix as the date format. Example:

Date:
  selector: //div[@class="value epoch"]/text()
  postProcess:
    - parseDate: unix


subtractDays: if set to true it subtracts the value in days from the current date and returns the resulting date in stash's date format. Example:

Date:
  selector: //strong[contains(text(),"Added:")]/following-sibling::text()
  postProcess:
    - replace:
        - regex: (\d+)\sdays\sago.+
          with: $1
    - subtractDays: true


replace: contains an array of sub-objects. Each sub-object must have a regex and with field. The regex field is the regex pattern to replace, and with is the string to replace it with. $ is used to reference capture groups - $1 is the first capture group, $2 the second and so on. Replacements are performed in order of the array.

Example:

CareerLength: 
  selector: $infoPiece[text() = 'Career Start and End:']/../span[@class="smallInfo"]
    postProcess:
      - replace:
          - regex: \s+to\s+
            with: "-"

Replaces 2001 to 2003 with 2001-2003.

subScraper: if present, the sub-scraper will be executed after all other post-processes are complete and before parseDate. It then takes the value and performs an http request, using the value as the URL. Within the subScraper config is a nested scraping configuration. This allows you to traverse to other webpages to get the attribute value you are after. For more info and examples have a look at #370, #606

Additionally, there are a number of fixed post-processing fields that are specified at the attribute level (not in postProcess) that are performed after the postProcess operations: * concat: if an xpath matches multiple elements, and concat is present, then all of the elements will be concatenated together * split: the inverse of concat. Splits a string to more elements using the separator given. For more info and examples have a look at PR #579

Example:

Tags:
  Name:
    selector: //span[@class="list_attributes"]
    split: ","

Splits a comma separated list of tags located in the span and returns the tags.

For backwards compatibility, replace, subscraper and parseDate are also allowed as keys for the attribute.

Post-processing on attribute post-process is done in the following order: concat, replace, subscraper, parseDate and then split.

Debugging support¶

To print the received html/json from a scraper request to the log file, add the following to your scraper yml file:

debug:
  printHTML: true


CDP support¶

Some websites deliver content that cannot be scraped using the raw html file alone. These websites use javascript to dynamically load the content. As such, direct xpath scraping will not work on these websites. There is an option to use Chrome DevTools Protocol to load the webpage using an instance of Chrome, then scrape the result.

Chrome CDP support can be enabled for a specific scraping configuration by adding the following to the root of the yml configuration:

driver:
  useCDP: true


Optionally, you can add a sleep value under the driver section. This specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that the scraper should wait after loading the website to perform the scrape. This is needed as some sites need more time for loading scripts to finish. If unset, this value defaults to 2 seconds.

When useCDP is set to true, stash will execute or connect to an instance of Chrome. The behavior is dictated by the Chrome CDP path setting in the user configuration. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version). As remote instance a docker container can also be used with the chromedp/headless-shell image being highly recommended.

CDP Click support¶

When using CDP you can use the clicks part of the driver section to do Mouse Clicks on elements you need to collapse or toggle. Each click element has an xpath value that holds the XPath for the button/element you need to click and an optional sleep value that is the time in seconds to wait for after clicking. If the sleep value is not set it defaults to 2 seconds.

A demo scraper using clicks follows.

name: clickDemo # demo only for a single URL
sceneByURL:
  - action: scrapeXPath
    url:
      - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/collapse/
    scraper: sceneScraper

xPathScrapers:
  sceneScraper:
    scene:
      Title: //head/title
      Details: # shows the id/s of the visible div/s for the Multiple targets example of the page
        selector: //div[@class="bd-example"]//div[@class="multi-collapse collapse show"]/@id
        concat: "\n\n"

driver:
  useCDP: true
  sleep: 1
  clicks: # demo usage toggle on off multiple times
    - xpath: //a[@href="#multiCollapseExample1"] # toggle on first element
    - xpath: //button[@data-target="#multiCollapseExample2"] # toggle on second element
      sleep: 4
    - xpath: //a[@href="#multiCollapseExample1"] # toggle off fist element
      sleep: 1
    - xpath: //button[@data-target="#multiCollapseExample2"] # toggle off second element
    - xpath: //button[@data-target="#multiCollapseExample2"] # toggle on second element


⚠️ Note: each click adds an extra delay of clicks sleep seconds, so the above adds 2+4+1+2+2=11 seconds to the loading time of the page.

Cookie support¶

In some websites the use of cookies is needed to bypass a welcoming message or some other kind of protection. Stash supports the setting of cookies for the direct xpath scraper and the CDP based one. Due to implementation issues the usage varies a bit.

To use the cookie functionality a cookies sub section needs to be added to the driver section. Each cookie element can consist of a CookieURL and a number of Cookies.

CookieURL is only needed if you are using the direct / native scraper method. It is the request url that we expect from the site we scrape. It must be in the same domain as the cookies we try to set otherwise all cookies in the same group will fail to set. If the CookieURL is not a valid URL then again the cookies of that group will fail.

Cookies are the actual cookies we set. When using CDP that's the only part required. They have Name, Value, Domain, Path values.

In the following example we use cookies for a site using the direct / native xpath scraper. We expect requests to come from https://www.example.com and https://api.somewhere.com that look for a _warning and a _warn cookie. A _test2 cookie is also set just as a demo.

driver:
  cookies:
    - CookieURL: "https://www.example.com"
      Cookies:
        - Name: "_warning"
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Value: "true"
          Path: "/"
        - Name: "_test2"
          Value: "123412"
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Path: "/"
    - CookieURL: "https://api.somewhere.com"
      Cookies:
        - Name: "_warn"
          Value: "123"
          Domain: ".somewhere.com"


The same functionality when using CDP would look like this:

driver:
  useCDP: true
  cookies:
    - Cookies:
        - Name: "_warning"
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Value: "true"
          Path: "/"
        - Name: "_test2"
          Value: "123412"
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Path: "/"
    - Cookies:
        - Name: "_warn"
          Value: "123"
          Domain: ".somewhere.com"


For some sites, the value of the cookie itself doesn't actually matter. In these cases, we can use the ValueRandom property instead of Value. Unlike Value, ValueRandom requires an integer value greater than 0 where the value indicates how long the cookie string should be.

In the following example, we will adapt the previous cookies to use ValueRandom instead. We set the _test2 cookie to randomly generate a value with a length of 6 characters and the _warn cookie to a length of 3.

driver:
  cookies:
    - CookieURL: "https://www.example.com"
      Cookies:
        - Name: "_warning"
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Value: "true"
          Path: "/"
        - Name: "_test2"
          ValueRandom: 6
          Domain: ".example.com"
          Path: "/"
    - CookieURL: "https://api.somewhere.com"
      Cookies:
        - Name: "_warn"
          ValueRandom: 3
          Domain: ".somewhere.com"


When developing a scraper you can have a look at the cookies set by a site by adding

a CookieURL if you use the direct xpath scraper

a Domain if you use the CDP scraper

and having a look at the log / console in debug mode.

Headers¶

Sending request headers is possible when using a scraper. Headers can be set in the driver section and are supported for plain, CDP enabled and JSON scrapers. They consist of a Key and a Value. If the Key is empty or not defined then the header is ignored.

driver:
  headers:
    - Key: User-Agent
      Value: My Stash Scraper
    - Key: Authorization
      Value: Bearer ds3sdfcFdfY17p4qBkTVF03zscUU2glSjWF17bZyoe8

headers are set after stash's User-Agent configuration option is applied. This means setting a User-Agent header from the scraper overrides the one in the configuration settings.

Plugins¶

Stash supports plugins that can do the following: - perform custom tasks when triggered by the user from the Tasks page - perform custom tasks when triggered from specific events - add custom CSS to the UI - add custom JavaScript to the UI

Plugin tasks can be implemented using embedded Javascript, or by calling an external binary.

⚠️ Note: Plugin support is still experimental and is likely to change.

Managing Plugins¶

Plugins can be installed and managed from the Settings > Plugins page.

Scrapers are installed using the Available Plugins section. This section allows configuring sources from which to install plugins. The Community (stable) source is configured by default. This source contains plugins for the current stable version of stash.

These are the plugin sources maintained by the stashapp organisation:

Name	Source URL	Recommended Local Path	Notes
Community (stable)	https://stashapp.github.io/CommunityScripts/stable/index.yml	stable	For the current stable version of stash.
Community (develop)	https://stashapp.github.io/CommunityScripts/develop/index.yml	develop	For the develop version of stash.

Installed plugins can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Plugins section.

Source URLs¶

The source URL must return a yaml file containing all the available packages for the source. An example source yaml file looks like the following:

- id: <package id>
  name: <package name>
  version: <version>
  date: <date>
  requires:
  - <ids of packages required by this package (optional)>
  - ...
  path: <path to package zip file>
  sha256: <sha256 of zip>
  metadata:
    <optional key/value pairs for extra information>
- ...


Path can be a relative path to the zip file or an external URL.

Adding plugins manually¶

By default, Stash looks for plugin configurations in the plugins sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the $HOME/.stash directory or the current working directory.

Plugins are added by adding configuration yaml files (format: pluginName.yml) to the plugins directory.

Loaded plugins can be viewed in the Plugins page of the Settings. After plugins are added, removed or edited while stash is running, they can be reloaded by clicking Reload Plugins button.

Using plugins¶

Plugins provide tasks which can be run from the Tasks page.

Creating plugins¶
Plugin configuration file format¶

The basic structure of a plugin configuration file is as follows:

name: <plugin name>
description: <optional description of the plugin>
version: <optional version tag>
url: <optional url>

ui:
  # optional list of css files to include in the UI
  css:
    - <path to css file>

  # optional list of js files to include in the UI
  javascript:
    - <path to javascript file>

  # optional list of plugin IDs to load prior to this plugin
  requires:
    - <plugin ID>

  # optional list of assets 
  assets:
    urlPrefix: fsLocation
    ...

  # content-security policy overrides
  csp:
    script-src:
      - http://alloweddomain.com

    style-src:
      - http://alloweddomain.com

    connect-src:
      - http://alloweddomain.com

# map of setting names to be displayed in the plugins page in the UI
settings:
  # internal name
  foo:
  # name to display in the UI
  displayName: Foo
  # type of the attribute to show in the UI
  # can be BOOLEAN, NUMBER, or STRING
  type: BOOLEAN

# the following are used for plugin tasks only
exec:
  - ...
interface: [interface type]
errLog: [one of none trace, debug, info, warning, error]
tasks:
  - ...


The name, description, version and url fields are displayed on the plugins page.

The exec, interface, errLog and tasks fields are used only for plugins with tasks.

The settings field is used to display plugin settings on the plugins page. Plugin settings can also be set using the graphql mutation configurePlugin - the settings set this way do not need to be specified in the settings field unless they are to be displayed in the stock plugin settings UI.

UI Configuration¶

The css and javascript field values may be relative paths to the plugin configuration file, or may be full external URLs.

The requires field is a list of plugin IDs which must have their javascript/css files loaded before this plugins javascript/css files.

The assets field is a map of URL prefixes to filesystem paths relative to the plugin configuration file. Assets are mounted to the /plugin/{pluginID}/assets path.

As an example, for a plugin with id foo with the following assets value:

assets:
  foo: bar
  /: .

The following URLs will be mapped to these locations: /plugin/foo/assets/foo/file.txt -> {pluginDir}/bar/file.txt /plugin/foo/assets/file.txt -> {pluginDir}/file.txt /plugin/foo/assets/bar/file.txt -> {pluginDir}/bar/file.txt (via the / entry)

Mappings that try to go outside of the directory containing the plugin configuration file will be ignored.

The csp field contains overrides to the content security policies. The URLs in script-src, style-src and connect-src will be added to the applicable content security policy.

See External Plugins for details for making plugins with external tasks.

See Embedded Plugins for details for making plugins with embedded tasks.

Plugin task input¶

Plugin tasks may accept an input from the stash server. This input is encoded according to the interface, and has the following structure (presented here in JSON format):

{
    "server_connection": {
        "Scheme": "http",
        "Port": 9999,
        "SessionCookie": {
            "Name":"session",
            "Value":"cookie-value",
            "Path":"",
            "Domain":"",
            "Expires":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "RawExpires":"",
            "MaxAge":0,
            "Secure":false,
            "HttpOnly":false,
            "SameSite":0,
            "Raw":"",
            "Unparsed":null
        },
        "Dir": <path to stash config directory>,
        "PluginDir": <path to plugin config directory>,
    },
    "args": {
        "argKey": "argValue"
    }
}


The server_connection field contains all the information needed for a plugin to access the parent stash server, if necessary.

Plugin task output¶

Plugin task output is expected in the following structure (presented here as JSON format):

{
    "error": <optional error string>
    "output": <anything>
}


The error field is logged in stash at the error log level if present. The output is written at the debug log level.

Task configuration¶

Tasks are configured using the following structure:

tasks:
  - name: <operation name>
    description: <optional description>
    defaultArgs:
      argKey: argValue


A plugin configuration may contain multiple tasks.

The defaultArgs field is used to add inputs to the plugin input sent to the plugin.

Hook configuration¶

Stash supports executing plugin operations via triggering of a hook during a stash operation.

Hooks are configured using a similar structure to tasks:

hooks:
  - name: <operation name>
    description: <optional description>
    triggeredBy:
      - <trigger types>...
    defaultArgs:
      argKey: argValue


Note: it is possible for hooks to trigger eachother or themselves if they perform mutations. For safety, hooks will not be triggered if they have already been triggered in the context of the operation. Stash uses cookies to track this context, so it's important for plugins to send cookies when performing operations.

Trigger types¶

Trigger types use the following format: <object type>.<operation>.<hook type>

For example, a post-hook on a scene create operation will be Scene.Create.Post.

The following object types are supported:

Scene
SceneMarker
Image
Gallery
Group
Performer
Studio
Tag

The following operations are supported:

Create
Update
Destroy
Merge (for Tag only)

Currently, only Post hook types are supported. These are executed after the operation has completed and the transaction is committed.

Hook input¶

Plugin tasks triggered by a hook include an argument named hookContext in the args object structure. The hookContext is structured as follows:

{
    "id": <object id>,
    "type": <trigger type>,
    "input": <operation input>,
    "inputFields": <fields included in input>
}


The input field contains the JSON graphql input passed to the original operation. This will differ between operations. For hooks triggered by operations in a scan or clean, the input will be nil. inputFields is populated in update operations to indicate which fields were passed to the operation, to differentiate between missing and empty fields.

For example, here is the args values for a Scene update operation:

{
    "hookContext": {
        "type":"Scene.Update.Post",
        "id":45,
        "input":{
            "clientMutationId":null,
            "id":"45",
            "title":null,
            "details":null,
            "url":null,
            "date":null,
            "rating":null,
            "organized":null,
            "studio_id":null,
            "gallery_ids":null,
            "performer_ids":null,
            "groups":null,
            "tag_ids":["21"],
            "cover_image":null,
            "stash_ids":null
        },
        "inputFields":[
            "tag_ids",
            "id"
        ]
    }
}

External Plugin Tasks¶

External plugin tasks are executed by running an external binary.

Plugin interfaces¶

Stash communicates with external plugin tasks using an interface. Stash currently supports RPC and raw interface types.

RPC interface¶

The RPC interface uses JSON-RPC to communicate with the plugin process. A golang plugin utilising the RPC interface is available in the stash source code under pkg/plugin/examples/gorpc. RPC plugins are expected to provide an interface that fulfils the RPCRunner interface in pkg/plugin/common.

RPC plugins are expected to accept requests asynchronously.

When stopping an RPC plugin task, the stash server sends a stop request to the plugin and relies on the plugin to stop itself.

Raw interface¶

Raw interface plugins are not required to conform to any particular interface. The stash server will send the plugin input to the plugin process via its stdin stream, encoded as JSON. Raw interface plugins are not required to read the input.

The stash server reads stdout for the plugin's output. If the output can be decoded as a JSON representation of the plugin output data structure then it will do so. If not, it will treat the entire stdout string as the plugin's output.

When stopping a raw plugin task, the stash server kills the spawned process without warning or signals.

Logging¶

External plugins may log to the stash server by writing to stderr. By default, data written to stderr will be logged by stash at the error level. This default behaviour can be changed by setting the errLog field in the plugin configuration file.

Plugins can log for specific levels or log progress by prefixing the output string with special control characters. See pkg/plugin/common/log for how this is done in go.

Plugin configuration file format¶
exec¶

For external plugin tasks, the exec field is a list with the first element being the binary that will be executed, and the subsequent elements are the arguments passed. The execution process will search the path for the binary, then will attempt to find the program in the same directory as the plugin configuration file. The exe extension is not necessary on Windows systems.

⚠️ Note: The plugin execution process sets the current working directory to that of the stash process.

Arguments can include the plugin's directory with the special string {pluginDir}.

For example, if the plugin executable my_plugin is placed in the plugins subdirectory and requires arguments foo and bar, then the exec part of the configuration would look like the following:

exec:
  - my_plugin
  - foo
  - bar


Another example might use a python script to execute the plugin. Assuming the python script foo.py is placed in the same directory as the plugin config file, the exec fragment would look like the following:

exec:
  - python
  - {pluginDir}/foo.py

interface¶

For external plugin tasks, the interface field must be set to one of the following values: * rpc * raw

See the Plugin interfaces section above for details on these interface types.

The interface field defaults to raw if not provided.

errLog¶

The errLog field tells stash what the default log level should be when the plugin outputs to stderr without encoding a log level. It defaults to the error level if no provided. This field is not necessary if the plugin outputs logging with the appropriate encoding. See the Logging section above for details.

Task configuration¶

In addition to the standard task configuration, external tasks may be configured with an optional execArgs field to add extra parameters to the execution arguments for the task.

For example:

tasks:
  - name: <operation name>
    description: <optional description>
    execArgs:
      - <arg to add to the exec line>

Embedded Plugin Tasks¶

Embedded plugin tasks are executed within the stash process using a scripting system.

Supported script languages¶

Stash currently supports Javascript embedded plugin tasks using goja.

Javascript plugins¶
Plugin input¶

The input is provided to Javascript plugin tasks using the input global variable, and is an object based on the structure provided in the Plugin input section of the Plugins page. Note that the server_connection field should not be necessary in most embedded plugins.

Plugin output¶

The output of a Javascript plugin task is derived from the evaluated value of the script. The output should conform to the structure provided in the Plugin output section of the Plugins page.

There are a number of ways to return the plugin output:

Example #1¶
(function() {
    return {
        Output: "ok"
    };
})();

Example #2¶
function main() {
    return {
        Output: "ok"
    };
}

main();

Example #3¶
var output = {
    Output: "ok"
};

output;

Logging¶

See the Javascript API section below on how to log with Javascript plugins.

Plugin configuration file format¶
exec¶

For embedded plugins, the exec field is a list with the first element being the path to the Javascript file that will be executed. It is expected that the path to the Javascript file is relative to the directory of the plugin configuration file.

interface¶

For embedded plugins, the interface field must be set to one of the following values: * js

Javascript API¶
Logging¶

Stash provides the following API for logging in Javascript plugins:

Method	Description
log.Trace(<string>)	Log with the trace log level.
log.Debug(<string>)	Log with the debug log level.
log.Info(<string>)	Log with the info log level.
log.Warn(<string>)	Log with the warn log level.
log.Error(<string>)	Log with the error log level.
log.Progress(<float between 0 and 1>)	Sets the progress of the plugin task, as a float, where 0 represents 0% and 1 represents 100%.
GQL¶

Stash provides the following API for communicating with stash using the graphql interface:

Method	Description
gql.Do(<query/mutation string>, <variables object>)	Executes a graphql query/mutation on the stash server. Returns an object in the same way as a graphql query does.
Example¶
// creates a tag
var mutation = "\
mutation tagCreate($input: TagCreateInput!) {\
  tagCreate(input: $input) {\
    id\
  }\
}";

var variables = {
    input: {
        'name': tagName
    }
};

result = gql.Do(mutation, variables);
log.Info("tag id = " + result.tagCreate.id);

Utility functions¶

Stash provides the following API for utility functions:

Method	Description
util.Sleep(<milliseconds>)	Suspends the current thread for the specified duration.

UI Plugin API¶

The PluginApi object is a global object in the window object.

PluginApi is considered experimental and is subject to change without notice. This documentation covers only the plugin-specific API. It does not necessarily cover the core UI API. Information on these methods should be referenced in the UI source code.

An example using various aspects of PluginApi may be found in the source code under pkg/plugin/examples/react-component.

Properties¶
React¶

An instance of the React library.

ReactDOM¶

An instance of the ReactDOM library.

GQL¶

This namespace contains the generated graphql client interface. This is a low-level interface. In many cases, StashService should be used instead.

libraries¶

libraries provides access to the following UI libraries: - ReactRouterDOM - Bootstrap - Apollo - Intl - FontAwesomeRegular - FontAwesomeSolid - Mousetrap - MousetrapPause

register¶

This namespace contains methods used to register page routes and components.

PluginApi.register.route¶

Registers a route in the React Router.

Parameter	Type	Description
path	string	The path to register. This should generally use the /plugin/ prefix.
component	React.FC	A React function component that will be rendered when the route is loaded.

Returns void.

PluginApi.register.component¶

Registers a component to be used by plugins. The component will be available in the components namespace.

Parameter	Type	Description
name	string	The name of the component to register. This should be unique and should ideally be prefixed with plugin-.
component	React.FC	A React function component.

Returns void.

components¶

This namespace contains all of the components available to plugins. These include a selection of core components and components registered using PluginApi.register.component.

utils¶

This namespace provides access to the NavUtils and StashService namespaces. It also provides access to the loadComponents method.

PluginApi.utils.loadComponents¶

Due to code splitting, some components may not be loaded and available when a plugin page is rendered. loadComponents loads all of the components that a plugin page may require.

In general, PluginApi.hooks.useLoadComponents hook should be used instead.

Parameter	Type	Description
components	Promise[]	The list of components to load. These values should come from the PluginApi.loadableComponents namespace.

Returns a Promise<void> that resolves when all of the components have been loaded.

hooks¶

This namespace provides access to the following core utility hooks: - useSpriteInfo - useToast

It also provides plugin-specific hooks.

PluginApi.hooks.useLoadComponents¶

This is a hook used to load components, using the PluginApi.utils.loadComponents method.

Parameter	Type	Description
components	Promise[]	The list of components to load. These values should come from the PluginApi.loadableComponents namespace.

Returns a boolean which will be true if the components are loading.

loadableComponents¶

This namespace contains all of the components that may need to be loaded using the loadComponents method. Components are added to this namespace as needed. Please make a development request if a required component is not in this namespace.

patch¶

This namespace provides methods to patch components to change their behaviour.

PluginApi.patch.before¶

Registers a before function. A before function is called prior to calling a component's render function. It accepts the same parameters as the component's render function, and is expected to return a list of new arguments that will be passed to the render.

Parameter	Type	Description
component	string	The name of the component to patch.
fn	Function	The before function. It accepts the same arguments as the component render function and is expected to return a list of arguments to pass to the render function.

Returns void.

PluginApi.patch.instead¶

Registers a replacement function for a component. The provided function will be called with the arguments passed to the original render function, plus the next render function as the last argument. Replacement functions will be called in the order that they are registered. If a replacement function does not call the next render function then the following replacement functions will not be called or applied.

Parameter	Type	Description
component	string	The name of the component to patch.
fn	Function	The replacement function. It accepts the same arguments as the original render function, plus the next render function, and is expected to return the replacement component.

Returns void.

PluginApi.patch.after¶

Registers an after function. An after function is called after the render function of the component. It accepts the arguments passed to the original render function, plus the result of the original render function. It is expected to return the rendered component.

Parameter	Type	Description
component	string	The name of the component to patch.
fn	Function	The after function. It accepts the same arguments as the original render function, plus the result of the original render function, and is expected to return the rendered component.

Returns void.

Scene Tagger¶

Stash can be integrated with stash-box which acts as a centralized metadata database. This is in the early stages of development but can be used for fingerprint/keyword lookups and automated tagging of performers and scenes. The batch tagging interface can be accessed from the scene view. For more information join our Discord.

Searching¶

The fingerprint search matches your current selection of files against the remote stash-box instance. Any scenes with a matching fingerprint will be returned, although there is currently no validation of fingerprints so it’s recommended to double-check the validity before saving.

If no fingerprint match is found it’s possible to search by keywords. The search works by matching the query against a scene’s title, release date, studio name, and performer names. By default the tagger uses metadata set on the file, or parses the filename, this can be changed in the config.

An important thing to note is that it only returns a match if all query terms are a match. As an example, if a scene is titled "A Trip to the Mall" with the performer "Jane Doe", a search for "Trip to the Mall 1080p" will not match, however "trip mall doe" would. Usually a few pieces of info is enough, for instance performer name + release date or studio name. To avoid common non-related keywords you can add them to the blacklist in the tagger config. Any items in the blacklist are stripped out of the query.

Saving¶

When a scene is matched stash will try to match the studio and performers against your local studios and performers. If you have previously matched them, they will automatically be selected. If not you either have to select the correct performer/studio from the dropdown, choose create to create a new entity, or skip to ignore it.

Once a scene is saved the scene and the matched studio/performers will have the stash_id saved which will then be used for future tagging.

By default male performers are not shown, this can be enabled in the tagger config. Likewise scene tags are by default not saved. They can be set to either merge with existing tags on the scene, or overwrite them. It is not recommended to set tags currently since they are hard to deduplicate and can litter your data.

Submitting fingerprints¶

After a scene is saved you will prompted to submit the fingerprint back to the stash-box instance. This is optional, but can be helpful for other users who have an identical copy who will then be able to match via the fingerprint search. No other information than the stash_id and file fingerprint is submitted.

Dupe Checker¶

The dupe checker searches your collection for scenes that are perceptually similar. This means that the files don't need to be identical, and will be identified even with different bitrates, resolutions, and intros/outros.

To achieve this stash needs to generate what's called a phash, or perceptual hash. Similar to sprite generation stash will generate a set of 25 images from fixed points in the scene. These images will be stitched together, and then hashed using the phash algorithm. The phash can then be used to find scenes that are the same or similar to others in the database. Phash generation can be run during scan, or as a separate task. Note that generation can take a while due to the work involved with extracting screenshots.

The dupe checker can be run with four different levels of accuracy. Exact looks for scenes that have exactly the same phash. This is a fast and accurate operation that should not yield any false positives except in very rare cases. The other accuracy levels look for duplicate files within a set distance of each other. This means the scenes don't have exactly the same phash, but are very similar. High and Medium should still yield very good results with few or no false positives. Low is likely to produce some false positives, but might still be useful for finding dupes.

Note that to generate a phash stash requires an uncorrupted file. If any errors are encountered during sprite generation the phash will not be generated. This is to prevent false positives.

Interactivity¶

Stash currently supports syncing with Handy devices, using funscript files.

In order for stash to connect to your Handy device, the Handy Connection Key must be entered in Settings -> Interface.

Funscript files must be in the same directory as the matching video file and must have the same base name. For example, a funscript file for video.mp4 must be named video.funscript. A scan must be run to update scenes with matching funscript files.

Scenes with funscript files can be filtered with the interactive criterion.

Captions¶

Stash supports captioning with SRT and VTT files.

These files need to be named as follows:

Scene¶
{scene_name}.{language_code}.ext
{scene_name}.ext

Where {language_code} is defined by the ISO-6399-1 (2 letters) standard and ext is the file extension. Captions files without a language code will be labeled as Unknown in the video player but will work fine.

Scenes with captions can be filtered with the captions criterion.

Note: If the caption file was added after the scene was initially added during scan you will need to run a Selective Scan task for it to show up.

Ways to contribute¶
Financial¶

Financial contributions are welcomed and are accepted using Open Collective.

Development-related¶

The Stash backend is written in Go, using a SQLite database. The UI is written in Typescript, using React. Bug fixes, improvements and new features are welcomed. Please see the DEVELOPMENT.md file for details on how to get started. Assistance is available via our Discord.

Documentation¶

Efforts to improve documentation in Stash helps new users and reduces the number of questions we have to field in Discord. Contributions to documentation are welcomed. While submitting documentation changes via GitHub pull requests is ideal, we will gladly accept submissions via GitHub issues or on Discord.

For those with web page experience, we also welcome contributions to our website (which as of writing is very undeveloped).

Testing features, improvements and bug fixes¶

Testing is currently covered by a very small group, so new testers are welcomed. Being able to build Stash locally is ideal, but binaries for pull requests are also available.

First, you will need to be signed in to GitHub. Find and open the relevant pull request, and then click on the Checks tab. On the right, there should be a button titled Artifacts - click that, and you should get a dropdown with links to download binaries built from that pull request for Linux, Windows and macOS.

Submitting and contributing to bug reports, improvements and new features¶

We welcome ideas for future improvements and features, and bug reports help everyone. These can all be found on GitHub.

Providing support¶

Offering support for new users on Discord is also welcomed.

Scraping scenes via stash-box
What is stash-box?¶

stash-box is an open-source video indexing and metadata API server for porn developed by Stash team. It provides a crowdsourced database of metadata for adult performers, studios and scenes.

Stash has several ways to scrape from stash-box instances. From automatic to manual. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Tagger (recommended) - partially automatic, great accuracy
Identify - fully automatic, mediocre accuracy
Scrape with... - fully manual, great accuracy
Prerequisites¶
Enable perceptual hashes (pHash)¶
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Under Library heading you will find configuration options for Scan task and Generate task.
Enable Generate perceptual hashes under Scan heading.
Enable Perceptual hashes under Generate heading.

Scan task and its options are applied when the content is being added to the database the first time.

Generate task and its options are applied when you want to generate additional things for content that is already in your database.

Configure stash-box endpoint¶

Known stash-box instances

A list of public stash-box instances is available here.

Go to 
 Settings > Metadata Providers.
Under Stash-box Endpoints heading click Add and include the details of the stash-box instance you want to add.
Click Test Credentials to make sure everything is correct.
Tagger¶

Recommended to people that value accuracy the most. It can automatically go through scenes and match them based on perceptual hash, but object creation and verification is left to you and nothing is saved until you click Save.

Go to 
 Tagger, which accessible from the toolbar.
Under Source select a stash-box instance you want to use.

Opposite the Source click on the 
 to open configuration.

You can enable Show male performers if you want them to be scraped for you locally.
You can disable Set scene cover image if you prefer to keep your existing cover.
You can enable Set tags if you want to be shown all the crowdsourced tags the scene has on the stash-box instance.

You can enable Mark as Organized on save which will apply 
 Organized flag.

Organized flag

Click on Scrape All and look through the results. Add missing objects and click Save.

If you got returned No results found, you can try using query method. You can enter title, performer, release date, or studio and click Search. Keep in mind that sometimes fewer details, are better.
If you know the scene exists on that stash-box instance, but it wasn't found, you can input the exact StashID in the Query field, click Search and it will return that exact scene.

For scenes that you clicked Save on, you can submit your file fingerprints (hashes) back to the instance to help improve the accuracy. Scroll to the top and click Submit x fingerprints.

Fingerprints
Identify¶

For people that want fully automatic option and don't mind some potential inaccuracies. The task will automatically go through all scenes and match them based on perceptual hash. You can also create all missing objects automatically. No manual verification is possible.

Warning

Task is irreversible, so it's a good idea to make a backup before running it.

Go to 
 Settings and enable Advanced Mode.
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Under Library heading click on Identify....

Under Sources select a stash-box instance(s) you want to match against.

Info

Identify task iterates through sources until it finds a match, once it finds a match, it will ignore all other sources for that scene.

Configure default options that will apply to all sources (they can be overwritten for individual sources by clicking 
 next to each source).

You can disable Show male performers if you don't want them to be scraped for you locally.
You can disable Set scene cover image if you prefer to keep your existing cover.
You can enable Set organized flag which will apply 
 Organized flag.
You can disable Skip matches that have more than one result if you don't mind potentially getting more mismatched results. If enabled, it can also be tagged with a custom tag to let you know which scenes were skipped.
You can disable Skip single name performers with no disambiguation if you don't mind potentially getting more mismatched results. If enabled, it can also be tagged with a custom tag to let you know which scenes were skipped.
Click Set as default to save your configuration.
Configure default field options that will apply to all sources (they can be overwritten for individual sources by clicking 
 next to each source).
Click Set as default to save your configuration.
Click Identify to start the task.
Scrape with...¶

In addition to previous methods, there is also a completely manual way to match scenes individually.

Go to a scene you want to match.
Click on the Edit tab.
Click Scrape with... and select a stash-box instance you want to match against.
Check the return results, create missing objects and click Apply.
Click Save.

Backup and restore database
Backup¶

Always use the UI to create a backup of the database. As with all live databases DO NOT copy manually the database file as a means of backup.

Stash uses an sqlite database with WAL mode enabled. This practically means that along with the main db file stash.go-sqlite there can be a -shm and a -wal file present (more info). Even stopping Stash might leave some of these index files present so again DO NOT manually copy the database file.

The Backup or Download Backup tasks are the proper way to create a backup file.

Go to 
 Settings > System.
Under Application Paths heading scroll down to Backup Directory Path.
Set directory to store your backups.
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Under Backup heading you will find 2 tasks.
Select either Backup or Download Backup task.
Restore¶

Assuming you have properly created a backup file you can use it to restore your database if needed.

Info

The restore procedure uses the default stash-go.sqlite filename, if you changed that when configuring Stash adjust accordingly.

The following steps are recommended when restoring a database file:

Go to 
 Settings > System, scroll down to Database heading and check your Database Path location.
Create a backup of the current database. (optional)
Stop Stash.
In your file browser, go to the location of your database path.
Move or delete the stash-go.sqlite database file (along with the -shm -wal .journal files if present).
Copy the backup file that you want to restore to stash-go.sqlite.
Make sure that you now have a stash-go.sqlite file and that no -shm -wal .journal files are present.
Start Stash.

You should now have Stash running with a working and restored database.

Advanced troubleshooting¶

If you get a database malformed message during upgrade or backup that probably means that the database is already corrupt. One way to get past that is to do a full export and check the error log. If there are not a lot of errors you can then try to do a full import and get a working db with minimal losses. As the full import is destructive proceed with caution. For cases like this it is better to ask for support.

Reverse proxy

The use of a reverse proxy for Stash is possible.

General¶

Generally, the following headers will need to be set (check your proxy's documentation for how to configure).

Host (http host)
X-Real-IP
X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded-Proto

See issue 134 for more information.

Using a URL prefix¶

Stash also supports running under a URL prefix, in which case the the X-Forwarded-Prefix header must also be set. The proxy also needs to remove the prefix from the requested URLs. For example, if you want your homepage to be accessible at http://example.domain.com/stash, then you need to set X-Forwarded-Prefix: /stash.

Setting External URL¶

You can also set the host that will be served by Stash manually by adding an external_host: setting in your Stash config.yml and assigning it the publicly accessible hostname, including the http:// or https://. X-Forwarded-Prefix will still need to be set if using a prefix.

external_host: http://example.domain.com


Server Configuration Examples¶
Nginx¶
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9999;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 60000s;
}

Nginx + Docker (Linuxserver Letsencrypt)¶

If you are using the linuxserver letencrypt docker you can use create a stash.subdomain.conf file in your proxy-confs folder and use this as the config:

# make sure that your dns has a cname set for stash

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    server_name stash.*;

    include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

    client_max_body_size 0;

    # enable for ldap auth, fill in ldap details in ldap.conf
    #include /config/nginx/ldap.conf;

    location / {
        # enable the next two lines for http auth
        #auth_basic "Restricted";
        #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd;

        # enable the next two lines for ldap auth
        #auth_request /auth;
        #error_page 401 =200 /login;

        include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
        set $upstream_app stash;
        set $upstream_port 9999;
        set $upstream_proto http;
        proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_read_timeout 60000s;
    }
}


Nginx with prefix¶

An example for nginx using the prefix /stash:

location /stash/ {
    # Notice the trailing slash - this causes nginx to remove the /stash prefix from requested URLs
    proxy_pass http://192.168.0.1:9999/;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /stash;
    proxy_read_timeout 60000s;
}

Nginx with external_host¶

Another example for nginx:

In this case we are using stash.home as our domain and 192.168.0.1 is stash's ip so edit acccordingly.

The external_host configuration option should also be set, in this case external_host: http://stash.home. Refer to external_host for more details.

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name stash.home;
    client_max_body_size 0;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.0.1:9999;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

Apache¶
# if using apache < 2.4.47, remove upgrade=websocket
ProxyPass "/stash" "http://127.0.0.1:9999" upgrade=websocket
ProxyPassReverse "/stash" "http://127.0.0.1:9999"
RequestHeader setIfEmpty X-Forwarded-Prefix "/stash"
ProxyPreserveHost on

# for name resolution
ServerAdmin admin@example.com
ServerName example.com
ServerAlias stash.example.com

# to enable websockets for apache < 2.4.47
#RewriteEngine on
#RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
#RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
#RewriteRule ^/?stash/(.*) "ws://127.0.0.1:9999/$1" [P,L]

# to add SSL
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/cert.key

Prerequisites¶
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests

sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod headers

# for SSL
sudo a2enmod ssl

Caddy v2¶
stash.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9999 {
        header_up Host {host}
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}
    }
}


The external_host configuration option should also be set, in this case external_host: http://stash.home. Refer to external_host for more details.

Troubleshooting¶
504 Errors¶
In some cases with big database files you might encounter 504 errors during stash db migration due to timeout. Adjusting the proxy_read_timeout value ( proxy.conf file in Letencrypt/Swag docker container)
422 Errors¶
In order for the websocket to work, you may need to also add these lines to your server block (proxy.conf file in the Letencrypt Unraid docker container for instance) as mentioned here should fix the issue.
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

Cloudflare Tunnel¶

Cloudflare Tunnels are not recommended since they throttle non-HTML traffic (which video falls under).

See Cloudflare blog post for more details.

Troubleshooting video playback
Inspecting files¶

You can use the ffprobe command to gather useful information about a video file:

ffprobe -show_format -show_streams big_buck_bunny.mkv


This can be useful for example, when filing bug reports, or discussing in chat.

Remuxing files¶

Another good test, is to see if remuxing the file into a new video file helps:

ffmpeg -i big_buck_bunny.mkv -c:v copy -c:a copy remuxed_file.mkv

Extracting a sample of a video¶

If you are asked for a sample of a video (e.g. for developers to analyse), you can use

ffmpeg -ss 120 -i big_buck_bunny.mkv  -t 30 -c:v copy -c:a copy 30_second_sample.mkv


The above command starts at the 120-second marker, and takes a 30-second sample of the video file.

Run CDP on TrueNAS Scale

Info

Written by WiiGe. Originally posted on stashapp/stash discussions1.

A way to use CDP scraper on TrueNAS Scale and install chromedp/headless-shell on TrueNAS Scale.

People using stash-app on TrueNAS Scale like me may face the problem that no supported CDP app by truecharts or truenas , and now I found a way to properly run chromedp/headless-shell.

This can be done by custom-app.

According to docker hub page of chromedp/headless-shell, we start container with docker run -d -p 9222:9222 --rm --name headless-shell --shm-size 2G chromedp/headless-shell, but this's not enough for TrueNAS Scale which run everything with K3s.

In order to run a docker image on K3s, we need to warp docker image with custom-app, fill the Container Repository with chromedp/headless-shell and Container Tag with latest so that TrueNAS can pull the image for you.

As for the docker args docker run -d -p 9222:9222 --rm --name headless-shell --shm-size 2G chromedp/headless-shell, we need to translate the args and env parameter into custom-app configuration. Under the Workload Settings section of custom-app configuration page, there will be a list of Extra Args, we put --name headless-shell --shm-size 2G here in custom-app way.

But due to this issue, K3s will report an error of zygote: ERROR:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(262)] Failed to adjust OOM score of renderer with pid 28: Permission denied (13), solution is simple - just offer extra args to disable it :--headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox --no-zygote --disable-software-rasterizer --disable-dev-shm-usage.

--remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --remote-debugging-port=9222 is not needed because we will set port and ip on Networking and Services section for LoadBalancer (I am using 192.168.1.45 and 9222, change it for your own scenario).

The Networking section and the final Extra Args page should be like this:

 

and click Install button then your headless-shell will be good to go.

The last step: just fill stash's CDP setting with http://192.168.1.45:9222/json/version(still, change ip:port for your own scenario), and now cdp should be running for you.

An extra note is Ingress section of custom-app, you may want to use chromedp/headless-shell remotely (e.g. accessing cdp by https://cdp.example.com/json/version), you need to modify the header of request with SetHeader function, see Host header is specified and is not an IP address or localhost. Obviously stash scraper do not support such operation, write your own scraper in this circumstances.

I just put the info I found together and share here, hope this page help more people who try to use CDP scraper on K3s-based OS.

Advanced configuration options

Some configuration options can not be edited through the UI and should only be used if needed.

Depending on the option they can be configured either by editing the config.yml configuration file or by using an enviroment variable or in a few cases by using flags when running stash.

As an example the port option can be changed from the default 9999 to 1234 by one of the below methods:

adding port: 1234 to the config.yml file
setting the ENV variable STASH_PORT to 1234 eg STASH_PORT=1234 ./stash
using the flag --port when running stash ./stash --port 1234
Configuration Option	YML	ENV	FLAG	Description	Comments
host	host	STASH_HOST	--host	The ip address for the host that stash is listening to	default: 0.0.0.0
port	port	STASH_PORT	--port	The port that stash serves to	default: 9999
external host	external_host	STASH_EXTERNAL_HOST	-	Needed in some cases when you use a reverse proxy	Docs
plugins path	plugins_path	-	-	The path to the stash plugins folder	Only use if you need to override the default
scrapers path	scrapers_path	-	-	The path to the scrapers folder	Only use if you need to override the default
custom served folders	custom_served_folders	-	-	Allows configuration of mapped URLs to file system folders	PR
maximum upload size	max_upload_size	-	-	Change the maximum size (in MB) for partial imports	default: 1024 (1GB)
proxy	proxy	-	-	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services	Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080
no proxy	no_proxy	-	-	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used	default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12

Bulk importing via CSV using gql-iterate

If you want to add a collection of performers, tags, studios, etc, and you have a text/spreadsheet list of them, here's the walkthrough of how to do it via a simple CLI method.

Step 1: Install gql-iterate¶

gql-iterate repository

npm install @efstajas/gql-iterate -g or yarn add @efstajas/gql-iterate -g

For latest versions of NodeJS (14>) you need to go where you globally install your npm modules (AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@efstajas/gql-iterate/bin) and add the following to the first line of the cli.js file.

import { createRequire } from 'module'; const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

Step 2: Prepare your gql.file if needed¶

See below for example versions of performers.gql and tags.gql samples that should work for you. Others can be figured out (with minor changes needeed) from stash/graphql/documents/mutations

These are NOT identical to the original files found above. Compare you'll see how they differ. This is very specific to be used for gql-iterate.

tags.gql
performers.gql
    mutation TagCreate( 
      $name: String!,
      $image: String) {
        tagCreate(input: { 
          name: $name,  
          image: $image 
        }) {
       id
      }
    }


If you have a suggested change, please add it below.

Step 3: Prepare your textfile or spreadsheet into a CSV¶

let's say you have a textfile with these performers (just names and eyecolors for a simple example) If you have a spreadsheet, add a first line with the column headers, you HAVE to provide all fields listed above in the first line, but you don't have to actually have data in them.

name,url,gender,birthdate,ethnicity,country,eye_color,height,measurements,fake_tits,career_length,tattoos,piercings,aliases,twitter,instagram,favorite,image

then add your data if text, or export as CSV if it's a spreadsheet (gender is not a string, see documentation in code, and favorite is a boolean, if you want to add those)

Alice,,,,,,blue
Betty,,,,,,green
Carter,,,,,,brown


the above lines all go into a file, like performerdata.csv

Gender is complicated due to Stash using GenderEnum.

For tags, you only need the tag title, and if desired, a url to a image

If you're unable to get this to work, then omit the favorite and image property from your CSV header, and from the performers.gql file.

Step 4¶

Note

Must use numerical IP instead of localhost.

Run this CLI command (assumes your files are in current directory and location for gql-interate is in your path)

gql-iterate --host http://_yourserverIP:portgoeshere_/graphql --input ./performerdata.csv --query ./performers.gql

It will run and add performers, it won't duplicate existing names, so you can run it multiple times if you want to add more names. Or delete something and readd it, if need be.

Manually editing the Stash sqlite3 database
Location¶

The Stash Sqlite3 database file is located at ~/.stash/stash-go.sqlite.

Before making changes to the Stash sqlite3 database - please make a backup first!

You can use the sqlite3 client to directly edit this file.

Opening the database file¶
cd ~/.stash
sqlite3 stash-go.sqlite

Examples¶
Deleting all tags¶

If you need to delete all tags, you can use the following commands:

sqlite> DELETE FROM scenes_tags;
sqlite> DELETE FROM tags;


Note

This will not work if you have Scene marker tags.

Scraping metadata behind login

A regular scraper can only scrape information from webpages that are open to the public access. If you want to scrape a webpage that requires login or behind a paywall, you need to use the "Visible CDP" technique.

Normal CDP scraping will launch a headless chrome browser, which will not show up for any user interactions. "Visible CDP" turns the "headless chrome" into a "visible" instance.

Prepare your scraper's .yml file and make sure it's valid and working. Your scraper should have the following setting inside:
driver:
  useCDP: true

Run a command console. Go to the Chrome's binary directory and run chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222. This will launch a special Chrome instance that Stash Scrapers can control later on.
In Stash, make sure that the Settings > Metadata Providers > Scraping > Chrome CDP Path is set to http://localhost:9222/json/version.
Use the special Chrome instance you launched earlier, go to the webpage you want to scrape, type in your user/pass or pass any other human tests, until you see the page with desired content.
Paste the webpage's URL in your Stash scene and start scraping. It should get the information correctly.

Scrapers

Scrapers are the way to retrieve information from websites for your scenes/groups/galleries/performers. Using scrapers wisely, you can avoid typing information manually and repetitively. They can help you quickly establish links between groups/scenes and performers/studios, add relative tags, then download covers/posters for easy recognition. It's a great feature to organize your video or image collections.

Managing scrapers¶

Scrapers can be installed and managed from the 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page.

Scrapers are installed using the Available Scrapers section. The Community (stable) source is configured by default.

Installed plugins can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Scrapers section.

Adding sources¶

Anyone can create their own source index for scrapers. To add a new source go to 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page and under Available Scrapers click Add Source.

Installing scrapers manually¶

By default, Stash looks for scrapers configurations in the scrapers sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the %USERPROFILE%\.stash\scrapers on Windows or /root/.stash/scrapers on Unix systems (Mac, Linux, etc.) or the current working directory.

Scrapers are added by adding configuration yaml files (format: scraperName.yml) to the scrapers directory.

Loaded scrapers can be viewed in the 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page. After scrapers are added, removed or edited while Stash is running, they can be reloaded by clicking 
 Reload scrapers button.

CommunityScrapers repository is the source for community maintained scrapers.

Scraper types¶
By searching type¶
Fragment¶

This kind of scrapers will fetch the metadata from a website, by using existing data from Stash, like a scene's file name, performer's name...etc. Fragment scrapers will get all the data Stash knows about that scene/performer/gallery, so it's quite flexible when fetching information.

Search by name¶

A Search-By-Name scraper will get only "name" input from a scene or performer, then it will search a website with that name, and return a list of results.

Scrapers includes: Babepedia.yml, FreeonesCommunity.yml, IAFD.yml

Search by URL¶

Most scrapers fetch metadata from a given URL, either by using XPath, JSON, or scripts. For this kind of scrapers you need to know the URL for that scene/performer/gallery/group so they can extract information from it.

Scrapers includes: All other scrapers.

By implementation¶
XPath and JSON scrapers¶

This is the most common type of scrapers, which use either XPath parser to pin-point the information and retrieve them, or send out JSON requests to get the information. xpathScraper and jsonScraper can be mixed in the same .yml file.

CDP scrapers¶

This type of scrapers is mostly the same as XPath/JSON scrapers, except it will launch a headless Chrome browser to retrieve the information from websites. It can also get cookies, simulate a mouse click and other actions. These scrapers have useCDP: true setting in them.

Python / Ruby scrapers¶

This type of scrapers will launch Python, Ruby to retrieve information from websites. Script scrapers are powerful, versatile and cross-platform. So they usually can do much more than regular scrapers. To install this kind of scrapers, you need to copy not only the .yml file, but also all the script files like .py, .rb that associated with it.

More details¶

You can view the detailed information about scrapers here or CommunityScrapers README.

Create your own¶

To create your own scraper, there is detailed information about that as well. Best way to start is to read the simple ones and understand how xpath works. The XPath Cheetsheet is quite useful in creating a .yml file. In Firefox you can use xpath search in "Web Developer Tools (F12)". The "search HTML" bar actually accepts xpath searches. You can use it to verify your xpath queries.

Contribution¶

The Scraper community always welcome new members. If you create a nice scraper and find it stable and useful, you can share it via the GitHub repository. Create a pull request, and let the mod review your work. The mods are busy, so it will probably take a few days, or a couple of weeks, but it will be a great feeling once your contribution is accepted by the community.

Description
Author
Screenshots

Video editing app that allows you to automate creating compilations from multiple videos. It runs in your browser. It's mostly made for, ahem, adult content, which is why it can connect to Stash and fetch videos and scene markers from there to guide the video creation process. You can also use local files and set the markers in ClipMash itself and then generate a compilation based on that.

StashBox Performer Bot¶

Author
Screenshots

Setup
How do I recover a forgotten username or password?¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following:

Close your Stash process;
Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor;
Delete the login and password lines from the file and save;
Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.
How can I connect to my server from elsewhere within my network?¶

Find the local IP address of your Stash Server (guides for Windows, MacOS, Linux). Then, on another device on your local network, open a browser to http://SERVER.IP.ADDRESS.HERE:9999.

See this article for ideas on accessing your stash from outside your network.

How do I serve Stash over SSL/TLS (HTTPS)?¶

This is typically accomplished by putting Stash behind a reverse proxy, such as Nginx or Caddy. Stash can also serve SSL directly. To use the built-in SSL:

First you must generate a SSL certificate and key combo.

Example using OpenSSL
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 7300 -nodes -keyout stash.key -out stash.crt -extensions san -config <(echo "[req]"; echo distinguished_name=req; echo "[san]"; echo subjectAltName=DNS:stash.server,IP:127.0.0.1) -subj /CN=stash.server


This command would need customizing for your environment. This link might be useful.

Once you have a certificate and key file name them stash.crt and stash.key and place them in the same directory as the config.yml file, or the ~/.stash directory. Stash detects these and starts up using HTTPS rather than HTTP.

How do I serve Stash in a Subpath?¶

The basepath defaults to /. When running stash via a reverse proxy in a subpath, the basepath can be changed by having the reverse proxy pass X-Forwarded-Prefix (and optionally X-Forwarded-Port) headers. When detects these headers, it alters the basepath URL of the UI.

Error: config initialization error: missing the following mandatory settings: generated¶
Find your config.yml file. Usually located at %userprofile%/.stash or $HOME/.stash.
Open it and find generated: line.
Replace with or add generated: absolute_path_to_your_generated_folder.
Save and try to start Stash.
Stash is showing a "FFMPEG Not Found" error¶

If Stash is unable to find or download FFMPEG, then download and install it yourself.

The ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe files should be placed in C:\Users\YourUsername\.stash on Windows. The ffmpeg and ffprobe files should be placed in ~/.stash on macOS / Linux.

I'm getting "Migration failed"¶

It can mean that you database got corrupted. You can verify that by running a few SQL statements. The easiest way to do so is to install a simple program called DB Browser for SQLite. Start the program and in the menu select File > Open Database... and select your Stash .sqlite database file. Then navigate to the Execute SQL tab and run: - PRAGMA integrity_check; - it should return ok. - PRAGMA foreign_key_check; - it should return nothing.

If you get something different it means there is an issue with your database. It's still possible that it can be recovered. You can ask for more help in one of the support channels.
Another option would be to try using an older backup if you have one.

My Python installation is not detected¶

Make sure your Python version is added to environment variable PATH. This is a common issue with Python installed from Microsoft Store on Windows.

How to add Python to PATH

If you use multiple versions or have non standard configuration you can specify which version to use in 
 Settings > System and under Applications Paths header set Python Executable Path.

How do I run multiple instances of Stash?¶

Running multiple instances of Stash can be done by specifying both the -c switch to denote an alternate config.yml filepath, and the --p switch to denote a unique port number.

Step-by-step Linux guide to running mutiple instances of Stash:

Create a new directory for the alternate Stash configuration, referred to here as NEW_DIRECTORY_LOCATION.
Choose a unique port number that does not conflict with other local Stash instances, referred to here as NEW_PORT_NUMBER.
Initiate Stash to assume a fresh installation by running ./stash-linux --port NEW_PORT_NUMBER -c NEW_DIRECTORY_LOCATION/config.yml.
Complete the Stash Setup Wizard.
Using a text editor, manually update config.yml to use NEW_PORT_NUMBER. Find the line port: 9999 and replace with port: NEW_PORT_NUMBER.
This instance of Stash can now be accessed by running ./stash-linux -c NEW_DIRECTORY_LOCATION/config.yml
Protecting against accidental exposure to the internet¶

Stash data is considered private, and Stash is not designed to be publicly exposed, except to trusted confidants. Stash has a built-in protection against accidentally exposing itself publicly outside of your network. If Stash receives a request from the public internet, and you do not have a password enabled, Stash will reject the request and stop handling requests to protect your privacy.

This often happens when you use the port-forwarding feature of your router or install Stash on a publicly accessible server, such as a VPS. When you do this, anybody in the world can access your Stash instance, so we enforce a password requirement. If your Stash instance has shutdown due to an insecure configuration, it will not handle requests again until you tell it that you have fixed the problem. After setting up either authentication, firewall, or removing your port forwarding rules, you can edit .stash/config/config.yml and remove the key security_tripwire_accessed_from_public_internet.

Alternative and safe methods to access your Stash¶

You may use several methods to safely access Stash from outside of your home network. In the most basic, you can enable authentication in Stash, and re-enable port forwarding. You can also use a VPN solution that allows you to securely access your home network, such as Tailscale, Zerotier, Wireguard, or others.

Using an external authentication provider¶

If you are an advanced user, and have secured your Stash instance behind an authwall provided by a reverse proxy or hosting solution, you may continue to use that. You simply have to edit .stash/config/config.yml and set dangerous_allow_public_without_auth to true. If you have already tripped the security feature, you will also have to remove the security_tripwire_accessed_from_public_internet key in order to allow Stash to serve requests.

Migrating from Windows to Unix or vice verse¶

Info

Migrating between filesystems with different path separators (/ and \) is currently unsupported.

Danger

Use at your own risk. If you do this, make sure backup your database before starting.

It's possible to manually migrate the folders table using SQL.

The following example query would replace \ with / and D:/ with /mnt/.

Example SQL query
UPDATE folders SET path = REPLACE(path, '\', '/');
UPDATE folders SET path = REPLACE(path, 'D:/', '/mnt/');

How can I move my library from one location to another?¶
Go to 
 Settings > Library.
Under Library heading find the old library path. Click 
 > Delete.
Now add your new library path. Click on Add Directory.
Select the directory you want to add and click Confirm.
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Under Library heading click Scan to start the task.

This will update all the paths for the existing objects without having to re-generate supported files.

Danger

Do not run a Clean task in between these steps, or you will lose the metadata from the affected objects. Your files will not be affected.

How does Stash keep track of scenes?¶

Stash tracks video files 2 ways:

oshash - fast hash created using partial file and filesize.
Filepath - exact library location where your file is stored.

Stash can still find the file even if one of them changes, all you need to do is run a scan task to trigger it. If both gets changed at the same time, Stash will create a new scene.

WebP images are not working in Safari¶

Performer images uploaded in WebP format will not display on versions of Safari prior to version 13 or on anything earlier than MacOS Big Sur. This is a limitation of Safari. As a workaround, ensure you are uploading performer images in .jpg or .png format.

Info

The cache directory is now required if using HLS/DASH streaming. Please set the cache directory in the System Settings page.

Info

The image data subsystem has been reworked in this release. Existing systems will have their storage system set to Database, which stores all image data in the database. This can be changed in the System Settings page.

A migration is required to change the storage system, and can be accessed from the Tasks page.

The Database storage system is not recommended for large libraries, as it can cause performance issues. The Filesystem storage system is recommended for large libraries, and is the default for new systems.

Info

The generated/screenshots jpg files are now considered legacy. These files can be migrated into the blob storage system by running the Migrate Screenshots task from the Tasks page.

Once migrated, these files can be deleted. The files can be optionally deleted during the migration.

You can configure your metadata sources under 
 Settings > Metadata Providers. See sections below for more details.

stash-box instances - more automatic, crowdsourced metadata
Scrapers - more individual, can be used for different databases, official studios

Scrapers

Scrapers are the way to retrieve information from websites for your scenes/groups/galleries/performers. Using scrapers wisely, you can avoid typing information manually and repetitively. They can help you quickly establish links between groups/scenes and performers/studios, add relative tags, then download covers/posters for easy recognition. It's a great feature to organize your video or image collections.

Managing scrapers¶

Scrapers can be installed and managed from the 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page.

Scrapers are installed using the Available Scrapers section. The Community (stable) source is configured by default.

Installed plugins can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Scrapers section.

Adding sources¶

Anyone can create their own source index for scrapers. To add a new source go to 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page and under Available Scrapers click Add Source.

Installing scrapers manually¶

By default, Stash looks for scrapers configurations in the scrapers sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the %USERPROFILE%\.stash\scrapers on Windows or /root/.stash/scrapers on Unix systems (Mac, Linux, etc.) or the current working directory.

Scrapers are added by adding configuration yaml files (format: scraperName.yml) to the scrapers directory.

Loaded scrapers can be viewed in the 
 Settings > Metadata Providers page. After scrapers are added, removed or edited while Stash is running, they can be reloaded by clicking 
 Reload scrapers button.

CommunityScrapers repository is the source for community maintained scrapers.

Scraper types¶
By searching type¶
Fragment¶

This kind of scrapers will fetch the metadata from a website, by using existing data from Stash, like a scene's file name, performer's name...etc. Fragment scrapers will get all the data Stash knows about that scene/performer/gallery, so it's quite flexible when fetching information.

Search by name¶

A Search-By-Name scraper will get only "name" input from a scene or performer, then it will search a website with that name, and return a list of results.

Scrapers includes: Babepedia.yml, FreeonesCommunity.yml, IAFD.yml

Search by URL¶

Most scrapers fetch metadata from a given URL, either by using XPath, JSON, or scripts. For this kind of scrapers you need to know the URL for that scene/performer/gallery/group so they can extract information from it.

Scrapers includes: All other scrapers.

By implementation¶
XPath and JSON scrapers¶

This is the most common type of scrapers, which use either XPath parser to pin-point the information and retrieve them, or send out JSON requests to get the information. xpathScraper and jsonScraper can be mixed in the same .yml file.

CDP scrapers¶

This type of scrapers is mostly the same as XPath/JSON scrapers, except it will launch a headless Chrome browser to retrieve the information from websites. It can also get cookies, simulate a mouse click and other actions. These scrapers have useCDP: true setting in them.

Python / Ruby scrapers¶

This type of scrapers will launch Python, Ruby to retrieve information from websites. Script scrapers are powerful, versatile and cross-platform. So they usually can do much more than regular scrapers. To install this kind of scrapers, you need to copy not only the .yml file, but also all the script files like .py, .rb that associated with it.

More details¶

You can view the detailed information about scrapers here or CommunityScrapers README.

Create your own¶

To create your own scraper, there is detailed information about that as well. Best way to start is to read the simple ones and understand how xpath works. The XPath Cheetsheet is quite useful in creating a .yml file. In Firefox you can use xpath search in "Web Developer Tools (F12)". The "search HTML" bar actually accepts xpath searches. You can use it to verify your xpath queries.

Contribution¶

The Scraper community always welcome new members. If you create a nice scraper and find it stable and useful, you can share it via the GitHub repository. Create a pull request, and let the mod review your work. The mods are busy, so it will probably take a few days, or a couple of weeks, but it will be a great feeling once your contribution is accepted by the community.

Installed plugins can be updated or uninstalled from the Installed Plugins section.

Adding sources¶

Anyone can create their own source index for plugins. To add a new source go to 
 Settings > Plugins page and under Available Plugins click Add Source.

Installing plugins manually¶

By default, Stash looks for plugin configurations in the plugins sub-directory of the directory where the stash config.yml is read. This will either be the %USERPROFILE%\.stash\plugins on Windows or /root/.stash/plugins on Unix systems (Mac, Linux, etc.) or the current working directory.

Plugins are added by adding configuration yaml files (format: pluginName.yml) to the plugins directory.

Loaded plugins can be viewed in the 
 Settings > Plugins page. After plugins are added, removed or edited while Stash is running, they can be reloaded by clicking 
 Reload plugins button.

Stash API¶

The Stash GraphQL API facilitates automated operations through a type-based schema that is both introspective and self-documenting.

Stash includes an integrated playground where users can execute queries and retrieve schema structures and documentation via a special introspection query.

You can access the playground by navigating to <server>:<port>/playground (default: http://localhost:9999/playground).
Click  on the left to access the Documentation Explorer.

All HTTP requests should be directed to <server>:<port>/graphql (default: http://localhost:9999/graphql).

Tip

For further information, visit the official GraphQL site.

Authentication¶

Include the API key generated in Stash in the header of every request. For details on obtaining the API Key, refer to Stash's in-app manual.

Example using curl

Replace <your_api_key> with your API Key found under 
 Settings > Security > Authentication.

Replace <graphql_query> with the raw query, which can be formatted using the playground.

curl -X POST -H "ApiKey: <your_api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql

Legacy cookie authentication¶

For configurations using a username/password, cookies must be used for authentication.

Example using curl
curl --verbose --cookie-jar cookie.txt --data 'username=stash&password=**' localhost:9999/login
curl --cookie cookie.txt -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql


It is recommended to use the API Key method over the legacy cookie method.

Stash API¶

The Stash GraphQL API facilitates automated operations through a type-based schema that is both introspective and self-documenting.

Stash includes an integrated playground where users can execute queries and retrieve schema structures and documentation via a special introspection query.

You can access the playground by navigating to <server>:<port>/playground (default: http://localhost:9999/playground).
Click  on the left to access the Documentation Explorer.

All HTTP requests should be directed to <server>:<port>/graphql (default: http://localhost:9999/graphql).

Tip

For further information, visit the official GraphQL site.

Authentication¶

Include the API key generated in Stash in the header of every request. For details on obtaining the API Key, refer to Stash's in-app manual.

Example using curl

Replace <your_api_key> with your API Key found under 
 Settings > Security > Authentication.

Replace <graphql_query> with the raw query, which can be formatted using the playground.

curl -X POST -H "ApiKey: <your_api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql

Legacy cookie authentication¶

For configurations using a username/password, cookies must be used for authentication.

Example using curl
curl --verbose --cookie-jar cookie.txt --data 'username=stash&password=**' localhost:9999/login
curl --cookie cookie.txt -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "<graphql_query>" }' localhost:9999/graphql


It is recommended to use the API Key method over the legacy cookie method.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.

Matrix
What is Matrix?¶

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email.

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server).

In comparison to Discord:
Username = Matrix ID
Channel = Room
Server = Space1

1 Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

Registration on Matrix¶

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them.

Popular homeservers¶
matrix.org (click to create an account)2
nitro.chat (click to create an account)
matrix.im (click to create an account)
List of other public homeservers on joinmatrix.org

2 Redirects to element.io domain, which is affiliated with matrix.org.

Clients¶

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website here.

Tip
Stash space¶

Our official space is located at #stashapp:unredacted.org.
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: #stashapp:matrix.im.

Tip

Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Stash rooms¶

Info

We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

Code of conduct
Our Pledge¶

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards¶

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery outside of areas that explicitly allow them, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities¶

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope¶

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, community servers, code repositories, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Enforcement¶

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. You can contact Admin or Org Lead members directly via Discord or using an integrated report function on other platforms.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Enforcement Guidelines¶

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

Warning¶

Offense: First time offence.

Consequence: A public or private written warning depending on the space where offense happened.

Temporary or Permanent Ban¶

Offense: Second time offense.

Consequence: Temporary or permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community and removal of any previously given elevated permissions.

Attribution¶

This Code of Conduct is a modified and adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

Code of conduct
Our Pledge¶

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards¶

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery outside of areas that explicitly allow them, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities¶

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope¶

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, community servers, code repositories, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Enforcement¶

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. You can contact Admin or Org Lead members directly via Discord or using an integrated report function on other platforms.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Enforcement Guidelines¶

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

Warning¶

Offense: First time offence.

Consequence: A public or private written warning depending on the space where offense happened.

Temporary or Permanent Ban¶

Offense: Second time offense.

Consequence: Temporary or permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community and removal of any previously given elevated permissions.

Attribution¶

This Code of Conduct is a modified and adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

Code of conduct
Our Pledge¶

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards¶

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery outside of areas that explicitly allow them, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities¶

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Note

Some Windows 11 versions might open Stash via Terminal instead of going to notification area. You can bypass that by running the program as administrator or use a shortcut to run it via conhost.exe.
As a result of running as administrator Stash might fail to detect your Python installtion in PATH, so you need point it the correct way yourself after installation. In 
 Settings > System and under Applications Paths header set Python Executable Path.

Install¶
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the notification area or by stopping the process from Task Manager.
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-win.exe binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.

Windows

Note

Some Windows 11 versions might open Stash via Terminal instead of going to notification area. You can bypass that by running the program as administrator or use a shortcut to run it via conhost.exe.
As a result of running as administrator Stash might fail to detect your Python installtion in PATH, so you need point it the correct way yourself after installation. In 
 Settings > System and under Applications Paths header set Python Executable Path.

Install¶
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

The program will show an icon in your notification area. You can access some quick links or quit the server from there.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the notification area or by stopping the process from Task Manager.
Download latest stash-win.exe binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-win.exe binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run the executable (typically stash-win.exe).

Running the executable might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click more info and then the run anyway button.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete the stash-win.exe binary file.
Delete %userprofile%/.stash folder.

macOS

On macOS, Stash can be run as either a packaged app (Stash.app) or as a command-line app (stash-macos). Both are universal apps, and will therefore run natively on both Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.

Packaged app¶

Note

The packaged app is recommended for most users.

It supports desktop notifications, displays a menu bar icon, and does not need to be launched from the terminal.

However, due to app restrictions, it only supports setting up in $HOME/.stash. If you would like to use a different folder, then you will need to use the command-line app.

Install¶
Download the latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Open Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the menu bar or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Delete old Stash app.
Open newly downloaded Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete Stash app.
Delete $HOME/.stash.
Command-line app¶

Note

The command-line app is only recommended for users who are familiar with the terminal, or for those who do not want to set up in $HOME/.stash.

It does not support desktop notifications and does not display a menu bar icon. It must be launched from the terminal.

Install¶
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either by closing the terminal window or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-macos binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

macOS

On macOS, Stash can be run as either a packaged app (Stash.app) or as a command-line app (stash-macos). Both are universal apps, and will therefore run natively on both Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.

Packaged app¶

Note

The packaged app is recommended for most users.

It supports desktop notifications, displays a menu bar icon, and does not need to be launched from the terminal.

However, due to app restrictions, it only supports setting up in $HOME/.stash. If you would like to use a different folder, then you will need to use the command-line app.

Install¶
Download the latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Open Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the menu bar or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Delete old Stash app.
Open newly downloaded Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete Stash app.
Delete $HOME/.stash.
Command-line app¶

Note

The command-line app is only recommended for users who are familiar with the terminal, or for those who do not want to set up in $HOME/.stash.

It does not support desktop notifications and does not display a menu bar icon. It must be launched from the terminal.

Install¶
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either by closing the terminal window or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-macos binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

macOS

On macOS, Stash can be run as either a packaged app (Stash.app) or as a command-line app (stash-macos). Both are universal apps, and will therefore run natively on both Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.

Packaged app¶

Note

The packaged app is recommended for most users.

It supports desktop notifications, displays a menu bar icon, and does not need to be launched from the terminal.

However, due to app restrictions, it only supports setting up in $HOME/.stash. If you would like to use a different folder, then you will need to use the command-line app.

Install¶
Download the latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Open Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either via icon in the menu bar or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest Stash.app.zip from GitHub repository.
Delete old Stash app.
Open newly downloaded Stash.app.zip archive and drag the Stash app to your Applications folder.
Open the Stash app.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete Stash app.
Delete $HOME/.stash.
Command-line app¶

Note

The command-line app is only recommended for users who are familiar with the terminal, or for those who do not want to set up in $HOME/.stash.

It does not support desktop notifications and does not display a menu bar icon. It must be launched from the terminal.

Install¶
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

Update¶
Stop Stash server. Either by closing the terminal window or by stopping the process from Activity Monitor.
Download latest stash-macos binary from GitHub repository.
Delete old stash-macos binary and replace it with the newly downloaded one.

Run ./stash-macos from the terminal.

If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x stash-macos to make the file executable.

If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete stash-macos.
Delete $HOME/.stash.

stash-linux = amd64 (x86_64)
stash-linux-arm32v6 = arm32v6 (armel)
stash-linux-arm32v7 = arm32v7 (armhf)
stash-linux-arm64v8 = arm64v8 (arm64)

Install¶
Download latest <binary-name> binary from GitHub repository depending on your architecture.
Run ./<binary-name> from the terminal.
If you have trouble, try running chmod u+x <binary-name> to make the file executable.
If everything went well, it should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.

You might be asked to perform a database migration depending on the changes included in the new release. Follow the steps.
Automatic backup will be performed before the migration.
If any issues arise during the migration your database will be automatically restored from the backup.
You should be good to go.
Remove¶
Stop Stash server.
Delete <binary-name> binary file.
Delete $HOME/.stash folder.

Synology

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l

# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile

Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group

Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Synology

Info

Written by Muldec.

Foreword¶

Synology devices comes in two categories : those who support containerization through Docker, and those who don't. To see in which category you stand, refer to the "Applied Models" section of the Docker Package page.

Now, follow the installation instructions based on whether you can use Docker or you cannot use Docker.

To install Stash with Docker¶

Note

Running Stash without Docker is possible even if your NAS is Docker ready. It offers more control on your Stash instance startup. As an example, it allows you to store your porn collection in an Encrypted Shared Folder, and only run Stash when the Encrypted folder is Mounted (Decrypted).

Make sure the Docker app is installed and running correctly.
Search the registry for stash and install.
Create a stash image with the following set up in 'advanced options'
"Volume" tab¶
File/Folder	Mount Path	Description
docker/Stash/generated	/generated	Thumbnails, clips, etc
docker/Stash/metadata	/metadata	Database
docker/Stash/config	/root/.stash	Configuration Files
docker/Stash/cache	/cache	Cache Files
docker/Stash/blobs	/blobs	Binary data for scene covers, performer images, etc
(where your porn lives)	/data	Location of your porn
"Environment" tab¶

(These will need to be the same as the Volumes you created in the "Volume" tab.)

variable	Value
PATH	(keep as is)
STASH_CACHE	/cache
STASH_METADATA	/metadata
STASH_GENERATED	/generated
STASH_STASH	/data
	
"Port" tab¶

You will need to set a default port in the "Port" tab, otherwise Docker will assign a different port every time Stash is launched. Leave the container port as-is.

"Network" tab¶

Make sure that "Use The Same Network As Docker Host" is checked.

(thanks to backer Herelam80 for these instructions)

To install Stash without Docker¶

Warning

This method uses SSH to run command lines on the NAS. If you are unfamiliar with SSH or linux command lines, I suggest you not to go further, as making a mistake in the SSH session can really screw your NAS.

This is intended to work on DSM 7.0 and later. It will not work on any version prior to 7.0.

Install Prerequisites¶

In DSM, navigate to Package Center > Settings. In the Package Sources tab, click Add, type SynoCommunity as Name and https://packages.synocommunity.com/ as Location and then press OK to validate.

Go back to the Package Center and look for Python 3.11 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Then look for Ffmpeg 6 in the Community tab. Click on Ìnstall and agree to the Third-Party Package warning.

Enable SSH¶

In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > Connectivity > Terminal & SNMP and check the Enable SSH service box.

Create a user that will run stash¶
In DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the Create button
Give it a name (eg stash) and a Password (you will need it later)
Click Next until you are on the "Join groups" screen
Assign the user to the "administrators" group (this will be removed later but is required by synology to be able to use SSH (I know, it's stupid) and complete the installation properly)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign shared folders permissions" screen
Assign the Read/Write permission to your porn folder (the write permission is needed to allow the deletion of clips from the stash app)
Click Next until you are on the "Assign application permissions" screen
Check Deny for all applications
Click Next until you can click on Done
Connect to your NAS¶

With your terminal, connect to your NAS using the newly created account that is part of the administrators group.

ssh stash@your_nas_hostname

Link ffprobe & ffmpeg¶

ffmpeg has been installed earlier, but is missing a link to ffprobe (also installed) and the new version of ffmpeg. Run the following command.

sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
sudo ln -s /var/packages/ffmpeg6/target/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg

Download Stash¶

Download the lastest version of Stash and its checksum from GitHub

# find what architecture your synology is running on
uname -m

# depending on the architecture, you'll have to download the right version of stash

# x86_64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux
# armv6l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v6
# armv7l
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm32v7
# aarch64
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-linux-arm64v8

# Download the CHECKSUM
wget https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/latest/download/CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# Perform the checksum validation
sha1sum -c --ignore-missing CHECKSUMS_SHA1

# you should see a line that says `stash-linux: OK`
# if not, something went wrong during the download

# Clean up the now unnecessary file
rm CHECKSUMS_SHA1


Danger

DO NOT run stash yet or it will generate a bunch of files/folders where we don't want them.

Python¶

Prepare a python environment (for scrapers and plugins)

python3.11 -m ensurepip --Update
python3.11 -m venv stash-env
source stash-env/bin/activate
pip3 install pipreqs

Configure your NAS to run Stash¶

Create a profile file

echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' > .profile
echo 'source stash-env/bin/activate' >> .profile


Create the service file by running cat > stash.service, copy/pasting the following, and hitting CTRL+D when it's done to save the file (hit again if you are not back to the prompt) :

[Unit]
Description=Run Stash at startup
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/services/homes/stash
Type=simple
User=stash
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c -l '\
   exec ./stash-linux'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note

Change the ExecStart line by providing the exact name of the stash executable that you downloaded previously.

Start and activate the service

sudo systemctl enable "$(pwd)/stash.service"
sudo systemctl start stash.service

Verify that it is working¶

You can now access to stash by navigating to your NAS url on port 9999 : http://nas-hostname:9999

Installing Scrapers and Plugins¶

Whenever you install a new python scraper or plugin, do the following from the stash user home directory

pipreqs .stash/.
pip3 install -r .stash/requirements.txt


Note

Using pipreqs allows to scan all scrapers and plugins installed and find dependencies that they require. You can do the same thing without pipreqs by going into each individual directory and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Remove stash user from administrator group¶
Go back to DSM, navigate to Control Panel > File Sharing > User & Group
Click on the stash user and then on Edit
In the User Groups tab, uncheck "administrators" and click on Save

FreeNAS/TrueNAS
TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

FreeNAS/TrueNAS
TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash

# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"

The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

FreeNAS/TrueNAS
TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

FreeNAS/TrueNAS
TrueNAS Scale¶

Info

The following step by step was tested using TrueNAS Scale Cobia (23.10.1.3).

Installation¶

To install the stashapp, we will use the TrueCharts app database. To install, we'll follow the official documentation at https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/

Go to Apps page from the top level SCALE menu
Click Discover Apps button on the Apps page
Click Manage Catalogs link on the Discover Apps page
Click Add Catalog
After reading the iXsystems notice, click Continue and enter the required information: Name: truecharts Repository: https://github.com/truecharts/catalog Preferred Trains: enterprise, stable and operators (type each one manually) Branch: main
Click Save and allow SCALE to refresh its catalog with TrueCharts (this may take a few minutes)

After the update is complete, use the search bar to search for "stash". When found, click Install.

Options¶

The installation window will contain several customizable options, but the most important one is the storage option. Search for "Additional App Storage" on the page and click "Add".

In "Type of Storage", select "Host Path" if the desired folder is a Dataset. "Host Path" should be where your content will be. "Mount Path" is the name that appears in the stash for the selection. You can put anything here, like /stash-content for example. After that, click Install.

Installation will take a few minutes. After the stash appears as "Running", click "Open" on the right and continue with the stash configuration. When entering the folder that contains its contents, remember to search for the same name you entered previously. In the case of this guide, the name was /stash-content.

TrueNAS Core¶

Info

We are now offering pre-compiled FreeBSD binary. You can grab it from release page.

Warning

The install guide below was reported as outdated.

Caveats and assumptions¶
The method documented here has only been given cursory testing, so there may be compatibility problems.
This method assumes that Stash will be run within a previously created iocage jail - the process to create and configure the jail is not included here.
If the jail is in NAT mode, ensure that port 9999 is forwarded to your TrueNAS host.
The alternative to this method is to compile from source, which is a more involved process and not documented here
Linux compatibility¶

In order for the stash-linux binary to work in a FreeBSD system, Linux compatibility must be enabled both in the system and the jail. To enable Linux compatibility:

navigate to System -> Tunables in the TrueNAS Web UI
click Add and enter the following:
Variable: linux_enable
Value: YES
Type: rc.conf
Click submit.
In a shell in your iocage jail, edit /etc/rc.conf to add:
enable_linux="YES"

Reboot the system.
Install ffmpeg/ffprobe¶

Go into your iocage jail and install ffmpeg

pkg install ffmpeg


Create user and group¶

It is recommended to not run services as root. Adjust this step to your system. in this example the user stash will be created and set to run the service.

pw useradd -n stash -u 1069 -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin

Download stash-linux¶

Choose where you would like to store the binary, in this example /usr/local/bin is selected as this is where the ffmpeg binaries also reside. Check github for latest release. Also remember to fix permissions and ownership

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/download/v0.22.1/stash-linux
chown stash:stash stash-linux
chmod +x stash-linux


Create configuration directory¶

stash needs a directory for its config file, database and more. Remember to change ownership and permission for the folder you select. The script we will look at in the next step has this path as the default:

mkdir /usr/local/etc/stash
chown stash:stash /usr/local/etc/stash


rc.d startup script¶

In order for stash to run as a daemon in the background, and also start at boot, you need a rc.d script.


mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
ee /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enter the following in the editor:
#!/bin/sh

# PROVIDE: stash
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown


. /etc/rc.subr

name=stash
rcvar=stash_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${stash_enable:="NO"}
: ${stash_user:="stash"}
: ${stash_group:="stash"}
: ${stash_config_dir:="/usr/local/etc/stash/config.yml"}
: ${stash_exec_bin:="/usr/local/bin/stash-linux"}

#daemon
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f -P ${pidfile} ${stash_exec_bin} --config ${stash_config_dir}"
start_precmd="stash_precmd"

stash_precmd() {
    install -o ${stash_user} -g ${stash_group} /dev/null ${pidfile}
}

run_rc_command $1

To save, press ESC + Enter and confirm with a and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/stash

Enable the service at boot¶

If you want Stash to run when you start the jail, run the following command:

sysrc "stash_enable=YES"

And to start the service, reboot the jail or run this command:
service stash start

Stash is now available at http://jail-IP:9999/

During setup you can leave all the paths for config, database and etc empty to use the default. They will then be stored in the config-folder we created earlier so you can easily backup the folder. Only add your media content.

Optional steps¶

You can change the location where stash stores the configuration files and database. Please note that the path needs to end with config.yml even if it does not exist yet. Stash will create it for you. Remember to fix ownership and permissions of the location you choose.

sysrc "stash_config_dir=path/to/location/config.yml"


You can change the user and group that Stash runs as. Remember that the config_dir needs to be owned by the user that Stash runs as, aswell as the stash-linux binary

sysrc "stash_user=usernamegoeshere"
sysrc "stash_group=groupnamegoeshere"


Its also possible to change the location of the stash-linux binary ``` sysrc "stash_exec_bin=/path/to/stash-linux"

Unraid

Info

Unraid app is maintained by a 3rd party. For Unraid specific support you can go to support thread by CorneliousJD.

Note

For users that want to try the development branch of Stash you can change the repository to stashapp/stash:development.

Install¶
Open Unraid and go to the Apps tab.
Enable apps (if disabled) and search for Stash.
You can modify paths to your preference.
Go to Docker tab and enable autostart for Stash.
Optional NVIDIA runtime¶

Info

binarygeek119/stash-cuda:latest repository is not maintained by Stash core team.

First off you need the unraid Nvidia plugin for this to work. On Unraid go to apps and do a search for nvidia driver and install, this will take some time to install. When the dialog is done it is still installing in the background. When it has finshed you will get a popup saying it is safe to reboot now.

Warning

Do not restart Unraid server until the plugin is done installing itself!

After getting the popup, reboot your server. After it back online you may continue to the next steps.

To begin modifing start by going into edit mode by right click on stash icon on Unraid dashboard or in Docker tab.
In edit mode go to the top and click on basic view to switch to advaced view.

 

Container configuration¶

Now we can change some thing to have Stash work with a Nvidia GPU.

Under Repository change the default Repository from stashapp/stash:development to binarygeek119/stash-cuda:latest.
 
Add the following under Extra Parameters: --runtime=nvidia.
 
Go down to the bottom of the page and click on Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device.

Change path to Variable and add the following:
Name: enter NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
Key: enter NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
Value: enter all
and click save.
  
Go down to the bottom of the page and click on Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device.

Change path to Variable and add the following:
Name: enter NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
Key: enter NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
Value: enter GPU-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   
Locating GPUID¶

Where GPU-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx you must enter your own GPUID. To find it do the folowing:

On a new Unraid page click on settings.
Go down to the bottom and click Nvidia Driver plugin.
Copy the key and paste it under Variable called Value.

Click on save.
Now click on apply and let the Docker download the new Nvidia version of Stash.
Enjoy and use as before.

First steps
Setting up content libraries¶
Go to 
 Settings > Library and click Add Directory.
To change the drive letter/volume, just type it in the field.
Select the folder containing the content you want to add. It will select the folder and all sub-folders.
Click Confirm.
Configuring scan options¶
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Select options you want based on your preferences, but keep in mind that every option increases time the scan will take.
You can stop and re-scan it will ignore the files that are already scanned and just scan new or missing files.
Initiating scan¶
Go to 
 Settings > Tasks.
Click Scan to start scanning for the content from your setup libraries or Selective Scan... if you want to scan a specific location.

Info

If you decide to cancel the task in the queue, next time you will start the task, it will skip the files that were already scanned.

Introduction¶

Stash works by cataloging your media using the paths that you provide. Once you have configured the locations where your media is stored, you can click the Scan button in Settings -> Tasks and stash will begin scanning and importing your media into its library.

For the best experience, it is recommended that after a scan is finished, that video previews and sprites are generated. You can do this in Settings -> Tasks. Note that currently it is only possible to perform one task at a time and but there is a task queue, so the generate tasks should be performed after scan is complete.

Once your media is imported, you are ready to begin creating Performers, Studios and Tags, and curating your content!

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

By default, new systems have MD5 calculation disabled for optimal performance. Existing systems that are upgraded will have the oshash populated for each scene on the next scan.

Changing the hashing algorithm¶

To change the file naming hash to oshash, all scenes must have their oshash values populated. oshash population is done automatically when scanning.

To change the file naming hash to MD5, the MD5 must be populated for all scenes. To do this, Calculate MD5 for videos must be enabled and the library must be rescanned.

MD5 calculation may only be disabled if the file naming hash is set to oshash.

After changing the file naming hash, any existing generated files will now be named incorrectly. This means that stash will not find them and may regenerate them if the Generate task is used. To remedy this, run the Rename generated files task, which will rename existing generated files to their correct names.

Step-by-step instructions to migrate to oshash for existing users¶

These instructions are for existing users whose systems will be defaulted to use and calculate MD5 checksums. Once completed, MD5 checksums will no longer be calculated when scanning, and oshash will be used for generated file naming. Existing calculated MD5 checksums will remain on scenes, but checksums will not be calculated for new scenes.

Scan the library (to populate oshash for all existing scenes).
In Settings -> System page, untick Calculate MD5 and select oshash as file naming hash. Save the configuration.
In Settings -> Tasks page, click on the Rename generated files migration button.
Parallel scan/generation¶
Number of parallel task for scan/generation¶

This setting controls how many sub-tasks will be run in parallel during scanning and generation tasks. (See Tasks)

Auto-detection can be enabled by setting this to zero. This will calculate the number of parallel tasks to be logical cores/4 + 1.

This setting can be used to increase/decrease overall CPU utilisation in two scenarios:

High performance 4+ core cpus.
Media files stored on remote/cloud filesystem.

Note: If this is set too high it will decrease overall performance and causes failures (out of memory).

Hardware accelerated live transcoding¶

Hardware accelerated live transcoding can be enabled by setting the FFmpeg hardware encoding setting. Stash outputs the supported hardware encoders to the log file on startup at the Info log level. If a given hardware encoder is not supported, it's error message is logged to the Debug log level for debugging purposes.

HLS/DASH streaming¶

To stream using HLS (such as on Apple devices) or DASH, the Cache path must be set. This directory is used to store temporary files during the live-transcoding process. The Cache path can be set in the System settings page.

ffmpeg arguments¶

Additional arguments can be injected into ffmpeg when generating previews and sprites, and when live-transcoding videos.

The ffmpeg arguments configuration is split into Input and Output arguments. Input arguments are injected before the input file argument, and output arguments are injected before the output file argument.

Arguments are accepted as a list of strings. Each string is a separate argument. For example, a single argument of -foo bar would be treated as a single argument "-foo bar". The correct way to pass this argument would be to split it into two separate arguments: "-foo", "bar".

Scraping¶
User Agent string¶

Some websites require a legitimate User-Agent string when receiving requests, or they will be rejected. If entered, this string will be applied as the User-Agent header value in http scrape requests.

Chrome CDP path¶

Some scrapers require a Chrome instance to function correctly. If left empty, stash will attempt to find the Chrome executable in the path environment, and will fail if it cannot find one.

Chrome CDP path can be set to a path to the chrome executable, or an http(s) address to remote chrome instance (for example: http://localhost:9222/json/version).

Authentication¶

By default, stash is not configured with any sort of password protection. To enable password protection, both Username and Password must be populated. Note that when entering a new username and password where none was set previously, the system will immediately request these credentials to log you in.

API key¶

If password protection is enabled, you may also generate an API key. An API key is used by external systems to access your stash system without needing to login first.

External systems using the API key must set the ApiKey header value to the configured API key in order to bypass the login requirement.

Logging out¶

The logout button is situated in the upper-right part of the screen when you are logged in.

Recovering from a forgotten username or password¶

Stash saves login credentials in the config.yml file. You must reset both login and password if you have forgotten your password by doing the following: * Close your Stash process * Open the config.yml file found in your Stash directory with a text editor * Delete the login and password lines from the file and save Stash authentication should now be reset with no authentication credentials.

Advanced configuration options¶

These options are typically not exposed in the UI and must be changed manually in the config.yml file.

Field	Remarks
custom_served_folders	A map of URLs to file system folders. See below.
custom_ui_location	The file system folder where the UI files will be served from, instead of using the embedded UI. Empty to disable. Stash must be restarted to take effect.
developer_options.extra_blob_paths	A list of alternative blob paths. These paths will be read for blob files. Blobs will not be written or deleted from these paths. Intended for developer use only.
max_upload_size	Maximum file upload size for import files. Defaults to 1GB.
theme_color	Sets the theme-color property in the UI.
gallery_cover_regex	The regex responsible for selecting images as gallery covers
proxy	The url of a HTTP(S) proxy to be used when stash makes calls to online services. Example: https://user:password@my.proxy:8080. Note: SOCKS5 proxies are unsupported.
no_proxy	A list of domains for which the proxy must not be used. Default is all local LAN: localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
sequential_scanning	Modifies behaviour of the scanning functionality to generate support files (previews/sprites/phash) at the same time as fingerprinting/screenshotting. Useful when scanning cached remote files.

The following environment variables are also supported:

Environment variable	Remarks
STASH_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE	Sets the SQLite cache size. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size. Default is -2000 which is 2MB.
Custom served folders¶

Custom served folders are served when the server handles a request with the /custom URL prefix. The following is an example configuration:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would serve D:\bar\bar.png.

The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would serve D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Configuration¶
Library¶

This section allows you to add and remove directories from your library list. Files in these directories will be included when scanning. Files that are outside of these directories will be removed when running the Clean task.

⚠️ Note: Don't forget to click Save after updating these directories!

Excluded patterns¶

Given a valid regex, files that match even partially are excluded during the Scan process and are not entered in the database. Also during the Clean task if these files exist in the DB they are removed from it and their generated files get deleted.
Prior to matching both the filenames and patterns are converted to lower case so the match is case insensitive.

Regex patterns can be added in the config file or from the UI.
If you add manually to the config file a restart is needed while from the UI you just need to click the Save button.
When added through the config file directly special care must be given to double escape the \ character.

There are 2 separate exclusion settings. One is for videos, another is for images/galleries.

Some examples:

"sample\.mp4$" will exclude all files ending in sample.mp4.
"/\.[[:word:]]+/" will exclude all hidden directories like /.directoryname/.
"c:\\stash\\videos\\exclude" will exclude specific Windows directory c:\stash\videos\exclude.
"^/stash/videos/exclude/" will exclude all directories that match /stash/videos/exclude/ pattern.
"\\\\stash\\network\\share\\excl\\" will exclude specific Windows network path \\stash\network\share\excl\.

Note: If a directory is excluded for images and videos, then the directory will be excluded from scans completely.

There is a useful regex101 site that can help test and experiment with regexps.

Gallery creation from folders¶

In the Library section you can find an option to create a gallery from each folder containing images. This will be applied on all libraries when activated, including the base folder of a library.

If you wish to apply this on a per folder basis, you can create a file called .nogallery or .forcegallery in a folder that should act different than this global setting.

This will either exclude the folder from becoming a gallery even if the setting is set, or create a gallery from the folder even if the setting is not set.

The file will only be recognized if written in lower case letters.

Files with a dot in front are handled as hidden in the Linux OS and Mac OS, so you will not see those files after creation on your system without setting your file manager accordingly.

Hashing algorithms¶

Stash identifies video files by calculating a hash of the file. There are two algorithms available for hashing: oshash and MD5. MD5 requires reading the entire file, and can therefore be slow, particularly when reading files over a network. oshash (which uses OpenSubtitle's hashing algorithm) only reads 64k from each end of the file.

The hash is used to name the generated files such as preview images and videos, and sprite images.

Interface Options¶
Language¶

Setting the language affects the formatting of numbers and dates.

Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type¶

The Scene Wall and Marker pages display scene preview videos (mp4) by default. This can be changed to animated image (webp) or static image.

⚠️ Note: scene/marker preview videos must be generated to see them in the applicable wall page if Video preview type is selected. Likewise, if Animated Image is selected, then Image Previews must be generated.

Show Studios as text¶

By default, a scene's studio will be shown as an image overlay. Checking this option changes this to display studios as a text name instead.

Scene Player options¶

By default, scene videos do not automatically start when navigating to the scenes page. Checking the "Auto-start video" option changes this to auto play scene videos.

The maximum loop duration option allows looping of shorter videos. Set this value to the maximum scene duration that scene videos should loop. Setting this to 0 disables this functionality.

Activity tracking¶

The "Track Activity" option allows tracking of scene play count and duration, and sets the resume point when a scene video is not finished.

The "Minimum Play Percent" gives the minimum proportion of a video that must be played before the play count of the scene is incremented.

By default, when a scene has a resume point, the scene player will automatically seek to this point when the scene is played. Setting "Always start video from beginning" to true disables this behaviour.

Custom CSS¶

The stash UI can be customised using custom CSS. See here for a community-curated set of CSS snippets to customise your UI.

Stash Plex Theme is a community created theme inspired by the popular Plex interface.

Custom Javascript¶

Stash supports the injection of custom javascript to assist with theming or adding additional functionality. Be aware that bad Javascript could break the UI or worse.

Custom Locales¶

The localisation strings can be customised. The master list of default (en-GB) locale strings can be found here. The custom locale format is the same as this json file.

For example, to override the actions.add_directory label (which is Add Directory by default), you would have the following in the custom locale:

{
  "actions": {
    "add_directory": "Some other description"
  }
}

Custom served folders¶

It is possible to expose specific folders to the UI. This configuration is performed manually in the config.yml file only.

Custom served content is exposed via the /custom URL path prefix.

For example, in the config.yml file:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would return D:\bar\bar.png. The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would return D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Applications for this include using static images in custom css, like the Plex theme. For example, using the following config:

custom_served_folders:
  /: <stash folder>\custom


The background.png and noise.png files can be placed in the custom folder, then in the custom css, the ./background.png and ./noise.png strings can be replaced with /custom/background.png and /custom/noise.png respectively.

Other applications are to add custom UIs to stash, accessible via /custom.

Interface Options¶
Language¶

Setting the language affects the formatting of numbers and dates.

Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type¶

The Scene Wall and Marker pages display scene preview videos (mp4) by default. This can be changed to animated image (webp) or static image.

⚠️ Note: scene/marker preview videos must be generated to see them in the applicable wall page if Video preview type is selected. Likewise, if Animated Image is selected, then Image Previews must be generated.

Show Studios as text¶

By default, a scene's studio will be shown as an image overlay. Checking this option changes this to display studios as a text name instead.

Scene Player options¶

By default, scene videos do not automatically start when navigating to the scenes page. Checking the "Auto-start video" option changes this to auto play scene videos.

The maximum loop duration option allows looping of shorter videos. Set this value to the maximum scene duration that scene videos should loop. Setting this to 0 disables this functionality.

Activity tracking¶

The "Track Activity" option allows tracking of scene play count and duration, and sets the resume point when a scene video is not finished.

The "Minimum Play Percent" gives the minimum proportion of a video that must be played before the play count of the scene is incremented.

By default, when a scene has a resume point, the scene player will automatically seek to this point when the scene is played. Setting "Always start video from beginning" to true disables this behaviour.

Custom CSS¶

The stash UI can be customised using custom CSS. See here for a community-curated set of CSS snippets to customise your UI.

Stash Plex Theme is a community created theme inspired by the popular Plex interface.

Custom Javascript¶

Stash supports the injection of custom javascript to assist with theming or adding additional functionality. Be aware that bad Javascript could break the UI or worse.

Custom Locales¶

The localisation strings can be customised. The master list of default (en-GB) locale strings can be found here. The custom locale format is the same as this json file.

For example, to override the actions.add_directory label (which is Add Directory by default), you would have the following in the custom locale:

{
  "actions": {
    "add_directory": "Some other description"
  }
}

Custom served folders¶

It is possible to expose specific folders to the UI. This configuration is performed manually in the config.yml file only.

Custom served content is exposed via the /custom URL path prefix.

For example, in the config.yml file:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would return D:\bar\bar.png. The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would return D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Applications for this include using static images in custom css, like the Plex theme. For example, using the following config:

custom_served_folders:
  /: <stash folder>\custom


The background.png and noise.png files can be placed in the custom folder, then in the custom css, the ./background.png and ./noise.png strings can be replaced with /custom/background.png and /custom/noise.png respectively.

Other applications are to add custom UIs to stash, accessible via /custom.

Interface Options¶
Language¶

Setting the language affects the formatting of numbers and dates.

Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type¶

The Scene Wall and Marker pages display scene preview videos (mp4) by default. This can be changed to animated image (webp) or static image.

⚠️ Note: scene/marker preview videos must be generated to see them in the applicable wall page if Video preview type is selected. Likewise, if Animated Image is selected, then Image Previews must be generated.

Show Studios as text¶

By default, a scene's studio will be shown as an image overlay. Checking this option changes this to display studios as a text name instead.

Scene Player options¶

By default, scene videos do not automatically start when navigating to the scenes page. Checking the "Auto-start video" option changes this to auto play scene videos.

The maximum loop duration option allows looping of shorter videos. Set this value to the maximum scene duration that scene videos should loop. Setting this to 0 disables this functionality.

Activity tracking¶

The "Track Activity" option allows tracking of scene play count and duration, and sets the resume point when a scene video is not finished.

The "Minimum Play Percent" gives the minimum proportion of a video that must be played before the play count of the scene is incremented.

By default, when a scene has a resume point, the scene player will automatically seek to this point when the scene is played. Setting "Always start video from beginning" to true disables this behaviour.

Custom CSS¶

The stash UI can be customised using custom CSS. See here for a community-curated set of CSS snippets to customise your UI.

Stash Plex Theme is a community created theme inspired by the popular Plex interface.

Custom Javascript¶

Stash supports the injection of custom javascript to assist with theming or adding additional functionality. Be aware that bad Javascript could break the UI or worse.

Custom Locales¶

The localisation strings can be customised. The master list of default (en-GB) locale strings can be found here. The custom locale format is the same as this json file.

For example, to override the actions.add_directory label (which is Add Directory by default), you would have the following in the custom locale:

{
  "actions": {
    "add_directory": "Some other description"
  }
}

Custom served folders¶

It is possible to expose specific folders to the UI. This configuration is performed manually in the config.yml file only.

Custom served content is exposed via the /custom URL path prefix.

For example, in the config.yml file:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would return D:\bar\bar.png. The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would return D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Applications for this include using static images in custom css, like the Plex theme. For example, using the following config:

custom_served_folders:
  /: <stash folder>\custom


The background.png and noise.png files can be placed in the custom folder, then in the custom css, the ./background.png and ./noise.png strings can be replaced with /custom/background.png and /custom/noise.png respectively.

Other applications are to add custom UIs to stash, accessible via /custom.

Interface Options¶
Language¶

Setting the language affects the formatting of numbers and dates.

Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type¶

The Scene Wall and Marker pages display scene preview videos (mp4) by default. This can be changed to animated image (webp) or static image.

⚠️ Note: scene/marker preview videos must be generated to see them in the applicable wall page if Video preview type is selected. Likewise, if Animated Image is selected, then Image Previews must be generated.

Show Studios as text¶

By default, a scene's studio will be shown as an image overlay. Checking this option changes this to display studios as a text name instead.

Scene Player options¶

By default, scene videos do not automatically start when navigating to the scenes page. Checking the "Auto-start video" option changes this to auto play scene videos.

The maximum loop duration option allows looping of shorter videos. Set this value to the maximum scene duration that scene videos should loop. Setting this to 0 disables this functionality.

Activity tracking¶

The "Track Activity" option allows tracking of scene play count and duration, and sets the resume point when a scene video is not finished.

The "Minimum Play Percent" gives the minimum proportion of a video that must be played before the play count of the scene is incremented.

By default, when a scene has a resume point, the scene player will automatically seek to this point when the scene is played. Setting "Always start video from beginning" to true disables this behaviour.

Custom CSS¶

The stash UI can be customised using custom CSS. See here for a community-curated set of CSS snippets to customise your UI.

Stash Plex Theme is a community created theme inspired by the popular Plex interface.

Custom Javascript¶

Stash supports the injection of custom javascript to assist with theming or adding additional functionality. Be aware that bad Javascript could break the UI or worse.

Custom Locales¶

The localisation strings can be customised. The master list of default (en-GB) locale strings can be found here. The custom locale format is the same as this json file.

For example, to override the actions.add_directory label (which is Add Directory by default), you would have the following in the custom locale:

{
  "actions": {
    "add_directory": "Some other description"
  }
}

Custom served folders¶

It is possible to expose specific folders to the UI. This configuration is performed manually in the config.yml file only.

Custom served content is exposed via the /custom URL path prefix.

For example, in the config.yml file:

custom_served_folders:
  /: D:\stash\static
  /foo: D:\bar


With the above configuration, a request for /custom/foo/bar.png would return D:\bar\bar.png. The / entry matches anything that is not otherwise mapped by the other entries. For example, /custom/baz/xyz.png would return D:\stash\static\baz\xyz.png.

Applications for this include using static images in custom css, like the Plex theme. For example, using the following config:

custom_served_folders:
  /: <stash folder>\custom


The background.png and noise.png files can be placed in the custom folder, then in the custom css, the ./background.png and ./noise.png strings can be replaced with /custom/background.png and /custom/noise.png respectively.

Other applications are to add custom UIs to stash, accessible via /custom.

Tasks¶

This page allows you to direct the stash server to perform a variety of tasks.

Scanning¶

The scan function walks through the stash directories you have configured for new and moved files.

Stash currently identifies files by performing a quick file hash. This means that if the file is renamed for moved elsewhere within your configured stash directories, then the scan will detect this and update its database accordingly.

Stash currently ignores duplicate files. If two files contain identical content, only the first one it comes across is used.

The scan task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Generate scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Generate previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Generate animated image previews*	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Generate scrubber sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Generate perceptual hashes	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate thumbnails for images	Generates thumbnails for image files.
Generate previews for image clips	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Rescan	By default, Stash will only rescan existing files if the file's modified date has been updated since its previous scan. Stash will rescan files in the path when this option is enabled, regardless of the file modification time. Only required Stash needs to recalculate video/image metadata, or to rescan gallery zips.
Auto Tagging¶

See the Auto Tagging page.

Scene Filename Parser¶

See the Scene Filename Parser page.

Generated Content¶

The scanning function automatically generates a screenshot of each scene. The generated content provides the following:

Video or image previews that are played when mousing over the scene card
Perceptual hashes - helps match against StashDB, and feeds the duplicate finder
Sprites (scene stills for parts of each scene) that are shown in the scene scrubber
Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Marker Screenshots	Generates static JPG images for markers. Only required if Preview Type is set to Static Image. Requires Marker Previews to be enabled.
Transcodes	Accessible in Advanced Mode - MP4 conversions of unsupported video formats. Allows direct streaming instead of live transcoding.
Perceptual hashes (for deduplication)	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes	Generates heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes.
Image Clip Previews	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Overwrite existing generated files	By default, where a generated file exists, it is not regenerated. When this flag is enabled, then the generated files are regenerated.
Transcodes¶

Web browsers support a limited number of video and audio codecs and containers. Stash will directly stream video files where the browser supports the codecs and container. Originally, stash did not support viewing scene videos where the browser did not support the codecs/container, and generating transcodes was a way of viewing these files.

Stash has since implemented live transcoding, so transcodes are essentially unnecessary now. Further, transcodes use up a significant amount of disk space and are not guaranteed to be lossless.

Image gallery thumbnails¶

These are generated when the gallery is first viewed, so generating them beforehand is not necessary.

Cleaning¶

This task will walk through your configured media directories and remove any scene from the database that can no longer be found. It will also remove generated files for scenes that subsequently no longer exist.

Care should be taken with this task, especially where the configured media directories may be inaccessible due to network issues.

Exporting and Importing¶

The import and export tasks read and write JSON files to the configured metadata directory. Import from file will merge your database with a file.

⚠️ Note: The full import task wipes the current database completely before importing.

See the JSON Specification page for details on the exported JSON format.

Tasks¶

This page allows you to direct the stash server to perform a variety of tasks.

Scanning¶

The scan function walks through the stash directories you have configured for new and moved files.

Stash currently identifies files by performing a quick file hash. This means that if the file is renamed for moved elsewhere within your configured stash directories, then the scan will detect this and update its database accordingly.

Stash currently ignores duplicate files. If two files contain identical content, only the first one it comes across is used.

The scan task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Generate scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Generate previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Generate animated image previews*	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Generate scrubber sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Generate perceptual hashes	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate thumbnails for images	Generates thumbnails for image files.
Generate previews for image clips	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Rescan	By default, Stash will only rescan existing files if the file's modified date has been updated since its previous scan. Stash will rescan files in the path when this option is enabled, regardless of the file modification time. Only required Stash needs to recalculate video/image metadata, or to rescan gallery zips.
Auto Tagging¶

See the Auto Tagging page.

Scene Filename Parser¶

See the Scene Filename Parser page.

Generated Content¶

The scanning function automatically generates a screenshot of each scene. The generated content provides the following:

Video or image previews that are played when mousing over the scene card
Perceptual hashes - helps match against StashDB, and feeds the duplicate finder
Sprites (scene stills for parts of each scene) that are shown in the scene scrubber
Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Marker Screenshots	Generates static JPG images for markers. Only required if Preview Type is set to Static Image. Requires Marker Previews to be enabled.
Transcodes	Accessible in Advanced Mode - MP4 conversions of unsupported video formats. Allows direct streaming instead of live transcoding.
Perceptual hashes (for deduplication)	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes	Generates heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes.
Image Clip Previews	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Overwrite existing generated files	By default, where a generated file exists, it is not regenerated. When this flag is enabled, then the generated files are regenerated.
Transcodes¶

Web browsers support a limited number of video and audio codecs and containers. Stash will directly stream video files where the browser supports the codecs and container. Originally, stash did not support viewing scene videos where the browser did not support the codecs/container, and generating transcodes was a way of viewing these files.

Stash has since implemented live transcoding, so transcodes are essentially unnecessary now. Further, transcodes use up a significant amount of disk space and are not guaranteed to be lossless.

Image gallery thumbnails¶

These are generated when the gallery is first viewed, so generating them beforehand is not necessary.

Cleaning¶

This task will walk through your configured media directories and remove any scene from the database that can no longer be found. It will also remove generated files for scenes that subsequently no longer exist.

Care should be taken with this task, especially where the configured media directories may be inaccessible due to network issues.

Exporting and Importing¶

The import and export tasks read and write JSON files to the configured metadata directory. Import from file will merge your database with a file.

⚠️ Note: The full import task wipes the current database completely before importing.

See the JSON Specification page for details on the exported JSON format.

Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Marker Screenshots	Generates static JPG images for markers. Only required if Preview Type is set to Static Image. Requires Marker Previews to be enabled.
Transcodes	Accessible in Advanced Mode - MP4 conversions of unsupported video formats. Allows direct streaming instead of live transcoding.
Perceptual hashes (for deduplication)	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes	Generates heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes.
Image Clip Previews	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Overwrite existing generated files	By default, where a generated file exists, it is not regenerated. When this flag is enabled, then the generated files are regenerated.
Transcodes¶

Web browsers support a limited number of video and audio codecs and containers. Stash will directly stream video files where the browser supports the codecs and container. Originally, stash did not support viewing scene videos where the browser did not support the codecs/container, and generating transcodes was a way of viewing these files.

Stash has since implemented live transcoding, so transcodes are essentially unnecessary now. Further, transcodes use up a significant amount of disk space and are not guaranteed to be lossless.

Image gallery thumbnails¶

These are generated when the gallery is first viewed, so generating them beforehand is not necessary.

Cleaning¶

This task will walk through your configured media directories and remove any scene from the database that can no longer be found. It will also remove generated files for scenes that subsequently no longer exist.

Care should be taken with this task, especially where the configured media directories may be inaccessible due to network issues.

Exporting and Importing¶

The import and export tasks read and write JSON files to the configured metadata directory. Import from file will merge your database with a file.

⚠️ Note: The full import task wipes the current database completely before importing.

See the JSON Specification page for details on the exported JSON format.

Tasks¶

This page allows you to direct the stash server to perform a variety of tasks.

Scanning¶

The scan function walks through the stash directories you have configured for new and moved files.

Stash currently identifies files by performing a quick file hash. This means that if the file is renamed for moved elsewhere within your configured stash directories, then the scan will detect this and update its database accordingly.

Stash currently ignores duplicate files. If two files contain identical content, only the first one it comes across is used.

The scan task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Generate scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Generate previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Generate animated image previews*	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Generate scrubber sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Generate perceptual hashes	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate thumbnails for images	Generates thumbnails for image files.
Generate previews for image clips	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Rescan	By default, Stash will only rescan existing files if the file's modified date has been updated since its previous scan. Stash will rescan files in the path when this option is enabled, regardless of the file modification time. Only required Stash needs to recalculate video/image metadata, or to rescan gallery zips.
Auto Tagging¶

See the Auto Tagging page.

Scene Filename Parser¶

See the Scene Filename Parser page.

Generated Content¶

The scanning function automatically generates a screenshot of each scene. The generated content provides the following:

Video or image previews that are played when mousing over the scene card
Perceptual hashes - helps match against StashDB, and feeds the duplicate finder
Sprites (scene stills for parts of each scene) that are shown in the scene scrubber
Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.

Tasks¶

This page allows you to direct the stash server to perform a variety of tasks.

Scanning¶

The scan function walks through the stash directories you have configured for new and moved files.

Stash currently identifies files by performing a quick file hash. This means that if the file is renamed for moved elsewhere within your configured stash directories, then the scan will detect this and update its database accordingly.

Stash currently ignores duplicate files. If two files contain identical content, only the first one it comes across is used.

The scan task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Generate scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Generate previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Generate animated image previews*	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Generate scrubber sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Generate perceptual hashes	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate thumbnails for images	Generates thumbnails for image files.
Generate previews for image clips	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Rescan	By default, Stash will only rescan existing files if the file's modified date has been updated since its previous scan. Stash will rescan files in the path when this option is enabled, regardless of the file modification time. Only required Stash needs to recalculate video/image metadata, or to rescan gallery zips.
Auto Tagging¶

See the Auto Tagging page.

Scene Filename Parser¶

See the Scene Filename Parser page.

Generated Content¶

The scanning function automatically generates a screenshot of each scene. The generated content provides the following:

Video or image previews that are played when mousing over the scene card
Perceptual hashes - helps match against StashDB, and feeds the duplicate finder
Sprites (scene stills for parts of each scene) that are shown in the scene scrubber
Marker video previews that are shown in the markers page
Transcoded versions of scenes. See below
Image thumbnails of galleries

The generate task accepts the following options:

Option	Description
Scene covers	Generates scene covers for video files.
Previews	Generates video previews (mp4) which play when hovering over a scene.
Animated image previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Generates animated previews (webp). Only required if the Preview Type is set to Animated Image. Requires Generate previews to be enabled.
Scene Scrubber Sprites	The set of images displayed below the video player for easy navigation.
Markers Previews	Generates 20 second video previews (mp4) which begin at the marker timecode.
Marker Animated Image Previews	Accessible in Advanced Mode - Also generate animated (webp) previews, only required when Scene/Marker Wall Preview Type is set to Animated Image. When browsing they use less CPU than the video previews, but are generated in addition to them and are larger files.
Marker Screenshots	Generates static JPG images for markers. Only required if Preview Type is set to Static Image. Requires Marker Previews to be enabled.
Transcodes	Accessible in Advanced Mode - MP4 conversions of unsupported video formats. Allows direct streaming instead of live transcoding.
Perceptual hashes (for deduplication)	Generates perceptual hashes for scene deduplication and identification.
Generate heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes	Generates heatmaps and speeds for interactive scenes.
Image Clip Previews	Generates a gif/looping video as thumbnail for image clips/gifs.
Overwrite existing generated files	By default, where a generated file exists, it is not regenerated. When this flag is enabled, then the generated files are regenerated.
Transcodes¶

Web browsers support a limited number of video and audio codecs and containers. Stash will directly stream video files where the browser supports the codecs and container. Originally, stash did not support viewing scene videos where the browser did not support the codecs/container, and generating transcodes was a way of viewing these files.

Stash has since implemented live transcoding, so transcodes are essentially unnecessary now. Further, transcodes use up a significant amount of disk space and are not guaranteed to be lossless.

Image gallery thumbnails¶

These are generated when the gallery is first viewed, so generating them beforehand is not necessary.

Cleaning¶

This task will walk through your configured media directories and remove any scene from the database that can no longer be found. It will also remove generated files for scenes that subsequently no longer exist.

Care should be taken with this task, especially where the configured media directories may be inaccessible due to network issues.

Exporting and Importing¶

The import and export tasks read and write JSON files to the configured metadata directory. Import from file will merge your database with a file.

⚠️ Note: The full import task wipes the current database completely before importing.

See the JSON Specification page for details on the exported JSON format.

Identify¶

This task iterates through your Scenes and attempts to identify the scene using a selection of scraping sources.

This task accepts one or more scraper sources. Valid scraper sources for the Identify task are stash-box instances, and scene scrapers which support scraping via Scene Fragment. The order of the sources may be rearranged.

For each Scene, the Identify task iterates through the scraper sources, in the order provided, and tries to identify the scene using each source. If a result is found in a source, then the Scene is updated, and no further sources are checked for that scene.

Options¶

The following options can be set:

Option	Description
Include male performers	If false, then male performers will not be created or set on scenes.
Set cover images	If false, then scene cover images will not be modified.
Set organised flag	If true, the organised flag is set to true when a scene is organised.
Skip matches that have more than one result	If this is not enabled and more than one result is returned, one will be randomly chosen to match
Tag skipped matches with	If the above option is set and a scene is skipped, this will add the tag so that you can filter for it in the Scene Tagger view and choose the correct match by hand
Skip single name performers with no disambiguation	If this is not enabled, performers that are often generic like Samantha or Olga will be matched
Tag skipped performers with	If the above options is set and a performer is skipped, this will add the tag so that you can filter for in it the Scene Tagger view and choose how you want to handle those performers

Field specific options may be set as well. Each field may have a Strategy. The behaviour for each strategy value is as follows:

Strategy	Description
Ignore	Not set.
Overwrite	Overwrite existing value.
Merge (default)	For multi-value fields, adds to existing values. For single-value fields, only sets if not already set.

For Studio, Performers and Tags, an option is also available to Create Missing objects. This is enabled by default. When true, if a Studio/Performer/Tag is included during the identification process and does not exist in the system, then it will be created.

Default Options are applied to all sources unless overridden in specific source options.

The result of the identification process for each scene is output to the log.
